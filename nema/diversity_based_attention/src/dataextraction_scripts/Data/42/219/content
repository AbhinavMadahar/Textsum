. USA Today - "Big payments on the debt start coming due in 2008, when the first of 78 million baby boomers — the generation born from 1946 to 1964 — qualify at age 62 for early retirement benefits from Social Security. The costs start mushrooming in 2011, when the first boomers turn 65 and qualify for taxpayer-funded Medicare." 
 -  Noam Chomsky, The Social Security Non-Crisis (2005)  - "What happened to the Baby Boomers when they were zero to 20? Weren’t working people taking care of them? And it was a much poorer society then. In the 1960s the demographics caused a problem but hardly a crisis. The bulge was met by a big increase in expenditures in schools and other facilities for children." 
 -  "The relevant number is what’s called the dependency ratio of working people to population.  That ratio reached its lowest point in 1965. It won’t reach that point again until 2080, according to Social Security Administration figures."
 -  Chomsky (2005) .
