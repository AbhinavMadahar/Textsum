Statewide standards are an improvement over major local failures:
 No Child Left Behind offers flexibility at state, local level
 States are free to opt out of No Child Left Behind
 NCLB testing is done more widely with greater effect
No Child Left Behind exerts too much federal power over states.
 No Child Left Behind encourages states to set low standards
 Education standards between states are inconsistent under NCLB
NCLB damages relationship/accountability of schools to community.
