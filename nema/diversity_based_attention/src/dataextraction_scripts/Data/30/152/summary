 NCLB has succeeded in improving test scores
Standardized tests ensures students learn essential information.
Standardized test info is more essential than music and arts.
NCLB tests what is testable; art and music is not testable.
 Schools should teach test-information as well as arts etc
Standards enables students to integrate well into new schools.
 NCLB encountered some problems due to low funding
 No Child Left Behind motivates unfortunate "teaching to the test":
 No Child Left Behind over-emphasizes math and reading:
No Child Left Behind does not inspire a love of learning.
 NCLB raises standards and testing without improving education
 No-Child-Left-Behind detracts from the education of the gifted.
NCLB gets teachers to over-focus on those just below passing
No Child Left Behind increases dropout rates.
