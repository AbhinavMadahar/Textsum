 Military recruiting in schools is entirely appropriate. National service is an important thing for young members of society to consider being a part of.  
 NCLB (In section 9528) requires public secondary schools to provide  military recruiters  the same access to facilities as a school provides to higher education institution recruiters. Schools are also required to provide contact information for every student to the military if requested, and schools are not required to tell the students or parents. Students or parents can opt out of having their information shared.<ref>(nd)  SEC. 9528. ARMED FORCES RECRUITER ACCESS TO STUDENTS AND STUDENT RECRUITING INFORMATION.  Department of Education.
