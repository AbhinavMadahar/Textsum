 Scientists have agreed that smoking is dangerous as tobacco smoke causes cancer, strokes and heart disease. Smoking does not just harm the smoker. It also harms people nearby, who breathe in the smoke. This kind of smoking is called passive smoking. Smokers choose to smoke, but people nearby do not choose to smoke passively. Most argue that people should only be exposed to harm if they understand the risks and choose to accept them. A complete ban on smoking in public is needed to protect people from passive smoking. Research suggests that partners of smokers have an increased chance of developing lung cancer, even if they do not use tobacco products. It is estimated that passive smoking kills approximately 80 000 people in the EU alone every year. (Brussels estimates that 15% of all deaths in the EU could be attributed to smoking.) 
 One's freedom to swing one's fist ends where someone else's nose begins. Similarly, the right to smoke ends exactly where it comes into conflict with the lungs, nasal passages, and health of others. Public places are such a place and - for example - non-smokers account for 70% of EU population. Therefore, in order to maintain the rights of non-smokers, smoking in public places should be banned.
 Many smokers excuse their public smoking on the grounds that they don't have anywhere to smoke. However, there's their private property and homes. Why not smoke there? 
Approximately 85% is breathed in by people who do not want to have it in their system.
 There are plenty of places ware there is no smoking allowed, especially lately. You can't smoke at work, you cant smoke in bars and so it is getting harder and harder to find places to smoke in public. So I don't see why people are putting up a big fuss about the whole thing.
