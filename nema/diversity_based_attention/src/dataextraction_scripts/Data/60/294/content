 Pubs and clubs should adapt, for example by trying to earn more money from selling food. After a ban was introduced in New South Wales (Australia), only 9% of restaurants reported a drop in trade.
 Smokers will not go to non-smoking places. The claim that more non-smokers will visit bars and restaurants has been proved to be untrue. These businesses would also earn less money from selling tobacco. In many places, pubs and Working Menâ€™s Clubs are important social places for communities. The smoking ban in the UK has had a devastating effect on the pub trade.
