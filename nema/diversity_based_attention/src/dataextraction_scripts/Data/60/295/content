 There have been few problems with bans where they have been introduced. Heavy fines put off companies from allowing people to smoke. A survey for the Scottish Executive found that 99.4% of premises were observing the ban three months after it was introduced.

 How the smokers can be efficient at work when they are  addicted  to nicotine, when a couple of cigarettes per day helps them to fulfill their tasks quickly and well?
