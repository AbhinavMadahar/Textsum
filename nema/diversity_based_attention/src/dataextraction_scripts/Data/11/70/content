 If more people choose covenant marriages, it simply proves that they reject the looser moral values of the liberal establishment. It would be unconstitutional for the government to discriminate in favour of one form of marriage over another, and in practice most people will have no idea what kind of marriage their neighbours, and other kidsâ€™ parents have.
 Couples planning to be married will face pressures from each other, their families, their ministers, and society at large to choose a covenant marriage. The traditional marriage will therefore be seen as a second-best option. One result of this is that many couples who would not have freely chosen a covenant marriage will feel forced into one.
