Children must be considered when parents divorce, but with appropriate nurturing and support, children can cope with divorce and eventually have strong marriages of their own.

And after all, until the twentieth century, mortality rates were such that many children experienced losing a parent while still young and having to adjust to their surviving parent’s remarriage.
