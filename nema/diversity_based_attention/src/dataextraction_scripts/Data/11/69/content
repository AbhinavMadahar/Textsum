 In 1968, the year before California adopted the nationâ€™s first no-fault divorce law, the US had 584 000 divorces (2.9 per 1 000 Americans). After 30 years of no-fault divorce, the number of divorces had reached 1,135,000 annually. Covenant marriages are the answer. Research has shown that 33% to 45% of couples on the brink of divorce may reconcile if they are legally prevented from divorcing for six months as specified in a covenant marriage.
 The US Supreme Court ruled more than 50 years ago that the state of residence at the time of the divorce determines the laws governing the divorce. So if the covenant marriage partners move to a state without covenant marriage laws, they are free to use the no-fault system anyway. This makes for a likely weak covenant marriage system.
