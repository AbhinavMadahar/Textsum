 The idea of sport is to compete your natural ability, and drugs are very bad for athletes. The use of performance-enhancing drugs leads to serious health problems, including “steroid rage”, the development of male characteristics in female athletes, heart attacks, and greatly reduced life expectancy. Some drugs are also addictive. With these results in mind, one must seek to eliminate and discourage the use of drugs by most athletes. We cannot condone wrongdoings for balance.
