  Eugene Robinson. "Roll over the Republicans". Real Clear Politics. February 10, 2009  - "Obama's plan was criticized by some Democrats for including a heavy component of tax cuts; that's the Republican prescription that helped get us into these desperate straits, and voters made clear in November that it's time to try something else. But Obama and his economic team found that there were only so many "shovel-ready" infrastructure projects to fund, and while straightforward government spending packs a bigger stimulative punch, tax cuts would help to some degree. So, from the beginning, the plan accommodated Republican ideology."
  Eugene Robinson. "Roll over the Republicans". Real Clear Politics. February 10, 2009  - "This is not, repeat not, a time for compromise. Meeting in the middle, which the Senate sees as its role in our democracy, renders the whole exercise potentially useless. If we don't get enough money into the economy, and if we don't do it soon, we risk wasting a king's ransom on a stimulus that's too puny to stimulate. [...] This is not an issue where the answer is to be found in the 'middle.' This isn't a matter of left, right and center, it's a matter of yes or no: Does the federal government try to get the economy moving again, or not?"
