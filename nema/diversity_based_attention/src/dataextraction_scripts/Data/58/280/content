 Even if government subsidy of the arts occasionally produced popular and acclaimed artistic successes, these will always be too infrequent to justify wasting public money on a great many more flops. Just as governments have proved to be very poor at centrally-directed economic planning, they are unlikely to be any better at centrally-directed artistic planning. Instead, they are more likely to channel resources inefficiently, stifling more creative and potentially popular endeavours elsewhere. And remember, money wasted on the arts is money that could be spent on schools, pensions and hospitals.
 Government-backed companies such as the National Theatre or Royal Shakespeare Company in Britain act as centres of excellence, training and nurturing young talent and thus helping to support a thriving commercial artistic sector as well. The arts can be an important attraction for tourists, bringing considerable revenue into the country.
