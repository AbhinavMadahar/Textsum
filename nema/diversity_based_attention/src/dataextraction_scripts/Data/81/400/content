 It is important that employers have good information on candidates so that they can judge most accurately whether a candidate is qualified. It is also important, given the problem of false resumes, for employers to have access to alternative sources of information for cross-referencing. But, equally important and relevant information regards the character of an individual, which social networking sites can help reveal. All of this information helps employers make better decisions and hire more effectively or "accurately".  
  Facebook profiles should be seen as a tool for job-seekers looking to expose their social-side and character to employers. Candidates can create good representations of their character on their profiles, and benefit from employer exposure to this information.
