 Social networking sites provide employers a true impression of a candidate.
Facebook can be used very effectively by candidates to showcase themselves to employers:
Companies have Facebook profiles that benefit job-seekers, making the trade-off acceptable for employers to seek information about candidates on these sites.
Social networks forbid employers from spamming, but not from collecting information.
 Facebook reveals no information of relevance to an employer.
