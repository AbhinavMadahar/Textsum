 Facbook was initially a university-based system that required that profiles be based on valid university email addresses. These email addresses are, in part, owned by the university. Because universities have some authority over these emails they also have some juridiction on the social-networking profiles that use these email addresses. 
 Kathryn Goldman, director of judicial affairs at the University of Delaware, said that the university administration has the right to punish students based on incriminating evidence obtained from Facebook profiles, according to the University Newspaper in March of 2006.[3]
 
 The problem is that this information and pictures do not clearly implicate the individual in any particular act.
 Facebook Patrol. "Administrators shouldn't be snooping around Facebook". March 9th, 2006 - "Apparently, reasonable law doesn't apply to the university, because nobody has to be caught in the act anymore to be accused of something like underage drinking. And because there's no possible way students couldn't have been drinking, or the beer can couldn't have been digitally added to the photograph, or there wasn't beer in that can, guilty is the charge."
Facebook Patrol. "Administrators shouldn't be snooping around Facebook". March 9th, 2006 - "The Review is outraged by this policy, since it reveals how deep the university will pervade students' personal space to protect its sqeeky-clean image. The Facebook is an independent enterprise and was never intended to be under the jurisdiction of another monitor. In fact, The Facebook's Terms and Conditions states that users may not post content that it deems threatening, vulgar, harmful, etc. - not our university, not any university."
