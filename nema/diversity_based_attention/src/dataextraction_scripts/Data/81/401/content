 Youth spend a significant amount of time online these days. Barring the possibility that children will shift away from social networking sties, it is important that parents attempt to make a connection with their children on these sites. It is not necessary to think that parents will be snooping on their children on social networking site. There is legitimate room for bonding to take place, and it should be encouraged.
  The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)  allows parents to review their child’s online profiles and blog pages for this purpose.
 Cyber bullies are individuals that bully and harass other individuals online. In a shocking case in 2007, a 13 year-old girl committed suicide after being bullied by neighbors on MySpace. If suicide is a possible result of cyber-bullying, parents should be actively engaged in monitoring profiles to protect their children against these activities. [2] 
 This applies to teachers and parents. The only way to instruct proper cyber behavior, though, is to see what people and children are actually posting, in this context, on their personal profiles and with other users.  

 As famous early 20th century psychiatrist  Carl Jung  said, "what you resist persists". The more parents try to constrain and direct children on social networking sites, the more they will seek to rebel and act outlandishly. By trying to bring attention to what is bad on social networking sties and in personal profiles, parents will actually bring greater attention to these things, and make children more conscious of the opportunity to take "nefarious" steps. This might have the reverse effect from what is intended by parents.
