 Gays are natural not immoral, should be accepted in armies
 Individual prejudice should not drive military policy
 If "immoral" gays banned from military, ban adulterers too
 Gays in military inevitable; lift ban sooner than later
 US military should not condone immoral homosexuality
 "Don't ask don't tell" maintains modest sexual values
 "Don't ask don't tell" preserves US military values
