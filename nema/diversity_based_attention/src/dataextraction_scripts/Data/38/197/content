  "Linguistic Unity Is Critical in an Increasingly Diverse Society." ProEnglish on Opposing Views.com : "America's linguistic unity, that enabled the melting-pot crucible to forge one nation out of millions of immigrants from all over the world, is under pressure as never before in our history. The record numbers of non-English speaking immigrants the United States is receiving is adding to the nationâ€™s diversity and putting enormous pressure on the assimilation process."
  Linguistic Society of America Resolution on English Only. July 1, 1987 : "The English language in America is not threatened. All evidence suggests that recent immigrants are overwhelmingly aware of the social and economic advantages of becoming proficient in English, and require no additional compulsion to learn the language." Indeed, roughly 94% of Americans already speak English. This is a very high number, compared to other countries that have much greater linguistic stratification. It is not necessary, therefore, to change anything and make any greater effort at compelling Americans to learn English.
