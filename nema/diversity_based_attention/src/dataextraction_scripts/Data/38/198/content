  "Why official language?" English as our official language : "Learning to speak English empowers immigrants. By more than 2-1 immigrants themselves say the U.S. should expect new immigrants to learn English (1) and by a 9-1 margin Hispanic immigrants believe learning English is essential to succeed in the U.S."
 While many say that there is plenty motivation for immigrants to learn English, then why is 5% of the population, 15 million, or 5 in every 100 individuals unable to speak English? Clearly, there is room for improvement, and Official English is a good way to give an extra boost of encouragement to those in the gap. 
 "The Myth of English as a Threatened Language." MALDEF on OpposingViews.com: "Latino immigrants are learning English, and doing so as quickly as or more quickly than previous generations of immigrants.  As is typical of immigrant populations in the United States, by the third generation most Latinos tend to speak only English.  Latino immigrants, then, do not need official English or English-only legislation to coerce them into learning English; that desire and determination already runs deep in the Latino community."
 "The Myth of English as a Threatened Language." MALDEF on OpposingViews.com: "The problem is not that immigrants are unwilling to learn English, but that there are not enough available educational resources for them. Today, many thousands of immigrants throughout the country are on the waiting lists for adult English classes."
