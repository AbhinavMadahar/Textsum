 According to some sources, over 85 percent of the worldâ€™s countries have at least one official language. [9]  Therefore, the United States is at odds with international norms in not having an official language. An official language is not out the ordinary or controversial, and this is evidenced by the international adoption of this norm. The United States, therefore, should take comfort in this fact if/when it decides to make English its official language. 
 Many people today believe that the US is the "#1" country in the world in several important ways; perhaps being *different* from countries with an official national language is one of our advantages. It certainly fits with America's inclusive history and culture. The United States has never been known to follow. Why should it do so by adopting English as its official language?
