 In Africa, European colonists exploited the mineral resources such as copper and diamonds. Land was effectively stolen from Native peoples; Self-determination and independence would offer recognition of the fact that they were unfairly treated and their proprietary rights abused. 

 In the post-Cold War Era we are moving away from nationalist ideology. The international community has frowned upon the rise of ethnic nationalism in Europe. The breakdown of Yugoslavia is indicative of how dangerous and destructive ethno-nationalism can be. Nationalism is about difference, which flies in the face of the idea of the global citizen. Nationalist causes are often pursued by violent terrorist organisations that ought not to be rewarded for their disregard of human life. By trying to recognise minority rights governments run the risk of treating people differently and giving minorities preferential treatment at the expense of the majority. National borders are becoming less significant definers of identity; Irish Americans, British Muslims, Catholic Africans and French-Speaking Arabs are all cogent identities. Boundaries are not the solution to the fear of the threat of cultural dilution or oppression.
