 Once, we condemned homosexuality as "unnatural" and "immoral". Now we know that that was wrong and that many suffered as a consequence of that prejudice. Should incest suffer the same fate? No. We should realize that our opinions will become more tolerant over time to incest, and we should move to increase such tolerance sooner than later.
  "Polygamy, Polyamory, Same Sex Incest Are As Legitimate As Gay Marriage". Current. January 2, 2009  - "If two brothers decide to enter into a lifelong commitment, the arguments in favor of gay marriage make it clear that they should have the right to do so. What would be your reasons for excluding them from the benefits of marriage?"
 Homosexuality does not have a direct impact on how family members interact with one-another. Incest, conversely, allows for disruptive sexual interaction between parents and their offspring as well as between siblings. This fundamentally damages the traditional nurturing function of family. For this reason, legal homosexuality and even gay marriage do not set a precedent for legalizing adult incest or incestuous marriage.
 Homosexuality is typically a relationship between equal parties. Incest, contrarily, is much more prone to abusive relations between older and younger siblings, father and daughter, or son and mother, before these individuals could be considered "consenting adults". It is this inherent prospect of abuse that makes incest different than homosexuality and compels the state to intervene.
