 Incestuous couples often do not have any children. It is wrong, therefore, to ban incest on the basis that it is bad for children of incest. Reproduction between incestuous couples could possibly be banned (a separate debate), but not all forms of incest on the basis of preventing "risky" reproduction.
 Humans very rarely have sex for the purpose of procreation. Most often, they have sex for mutual pleasure. This is perfectly moral. Incestuous couples that choose merely to have sex for pleasure, therefore, are doing nothing wrong by not having sex for the purpose of reproduction. 
 Sexual intercourse is done to produce children and not simply to get your rocks off. Legally allowing incestuous sex (but not reproduction) sends the wrong message regarding what sex should be for - reproduction only.
