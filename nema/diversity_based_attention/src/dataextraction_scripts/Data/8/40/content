  Joachim Renzikowski, a criminal law professor at Germany's Halle University, quoted in a 2007 BBC article - "I doubt equally that getting rid of our incest law will result in any measurable increase in cases. Our moral guardians don't need to get too worked up about this." [11] 
 Legalizing incest does more than acknowledge it â€“ it legitimises it with a mark of state approval. The costs of legitimizing incest in this way are quite large for the state and society. First, by making the practice appear acceptable, the state actually may encourage incestuous relationships within families between brothers and sisters, fathers and daughters, mothers and son, and between cousins. It makes it possible for individuals to move from considering incest as entirely unacceptable to considering it a socially-acceptable possibility. This significant shift will doubtlessly open incestuous doors that were once closed, encourage experimentation in incest, increase cases of abusive incestuous relations, and a general increase the number of incestuous relationships. Such a result is undesirable, so the state has a direct interest in preventing it by maintaining a ban.
