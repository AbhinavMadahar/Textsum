 Multiple studies show that the risk of defects among the offspring of first cousins is roughly 7%. This is only roughly 3% or 4% higher than the general populations risks of reproducing defectively, which is roughly 3% or 4%. While this represents a rough doubling of risks, it is still a relatively low and tolerable percentage.
