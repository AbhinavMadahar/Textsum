 If each plastic bag cost - say, 10 cents, then people would not use them in large amounts because they are paying. If someone shopping twice a week, using six plastic bags each shop, and the bags cost 10c each, they would realize that that would cost over $60 a year so they would either not use as many, OR this may be an incentive to reuse plastic bags.
 It would be a fair intention of the Government to start charging a small fee but the amount is so small, it's not really fair to charge that fee anyway, but people will just buy the bags if they have to. It will not deter most people and most people will just pay the money.
 Nearly all supermarkets get provided plastic shopping bags for free. It is really not fair for supermarket chains to profit up to 50c a bag when they are used in very large numbers and they get the bags for free.
