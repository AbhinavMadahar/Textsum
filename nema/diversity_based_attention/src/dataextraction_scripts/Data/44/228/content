 Plastic shopping bags take thousands of years to break down and thus they are harmful for the environment and deadly for the sea life. Every year, billions of plastic bags are used and thrown away. Plastic bags are NOT made from a renewable source and we are wasting tons of resources every year with plastic bags. A lot of plastic is used to make the billions of plastic every year and usually isn't recycled. Using plastic bags as bin liners is not really recycling because you throw them away once they are filled with rubbish.  Every year Australia alone uses over 6 billion plastic bags and over 80 million end up clogging up the streets, drains and parks.  [1] 
 Banning plastic bags would save plastic, but add to the environmentally harmful production of paper and cloth. We do still need something to put shopping or rubbish in and if we stop using plastic for the bags, we'll start using another resource which will be bad for the environment such as paper or cloth. We do need plastic.
