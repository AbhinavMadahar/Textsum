 The main argument here is that vouchers are only individual aid, giving individuals the choice to go to a religious school, but of course not mandating that they do so. Vouchers, therefore, can only indirectly support religious schools, and so should not be as a violation of the Establishment clause and the separation of church and state. 
 The inclusion in 1998 of religious private schools in the Milwaukee voucher program led to more than a three-fold increase in the number of private schools and almost a four-fold increase in the number of choice students, and to a further improvement of the public schools.
 Education is used to inculcate values that the society believes in and to promote social and civic awareness. Religious schools promoting anti-female policies, for example, should not be receiving taxpayer funding in the form of vouchers. This violates the constitutional separation of church and state. State funds cannot be separated from state control. It matters not whether the state is not directly making the choice to fund religious schools. Taxpayer funds should not be allowed to be directed toward religious schools. [15]
