 Voucher competition between public school districts spurs public schools to improve student outcomes. In Chile, attending a private school subsidized by vouchers is associated with increased standardized test scores. 
 Children that op-out of schools that are not serving them well are more likely to graduate than those who remain at schools that are failing them. [7]  In Columbia, for example, school voucher programs were reported to have increased secondary school completion rates by 15-20%.  [8] 
 In Chicago, there is little evidence that attending school choice programs provides any benefit on a wide variety of traditional academic measures, including standardized test scores, attendance rates, course-taking, and credit accumulation. In the Netherlands, where parents are free to choose the school for their children, higher competition is associated with lower student achievement in upper secondary education.
