 When Jesus talked about his second coming the New Testament, he mentioned that at the moment he comes, some will be asleep while others awake and working, hinting that Jesus knew that the world was not flat so that there could be day and night at the same time, ages before this fact was discovered.
 It is highly improbable that this narrative was not divinely inspired as the chances that the author of Genesis (probably Moses) could have guessed everything correctly is pitifully small.
 Our opponents have dismissed the premise as not counting as scientific knowledge, but now everyone knows that the Earth is not flat. They also dismiss the conclusion, giving a list of other possible sources of this scientific information for these Biblical sources, but if they feel that the Bible is too far fetched, then how much more are their alternatives! Do they believe that they exist yet God does not? If so, why?
