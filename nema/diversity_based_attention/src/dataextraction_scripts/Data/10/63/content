 Without cuts to CO2 emissions, Geo-engineering is the last option. Many experts warn that if CO2 emissions aren't cut drastically, then Geo-engineering will be the last option. If it  is  the last and only option, the international implications would be that if nothing is done, the Earth would be doomed, so it is very likely that, internationally, Geo-engineering solutions would be accepted widely. 
 For instance, planting artificial trees that act like a vacuum - sucking the CO2 out of the air - could be one of the solutions that are used internationally. This, painting the tops of rooftops white, and other innocuous solutions are entirely uncontroversial and will not cause international tensions of any kind.
  Jamais Cascio. "It's Time to Cool the Planet." The Wall Street Journal. June 15th, 2009 : "the deployment of geoengineering would lead to international tension. Who decides what the ideal temperature would be? Russia? India? The U.S.? Who's to blame if Country A's geoengineering efforts cause a drought in Country B?"
 It’s a worldwide decision. What if a country doesn’t agree or doesn’t think it’s a good idea? This is such an intractable problem, it probably makes the most sense to avoid geoengineering all together. 
  Alan Robock. "Has the time come for geoengineering?" The Bulletin. August 14th, 2008 : "The United States has a long history of trying to modify weather for military purposes, including inducing rain during the Vietnam War to swamp North Vietnamese supply lines and disrupt antiwar protests by Buddhist monks."
