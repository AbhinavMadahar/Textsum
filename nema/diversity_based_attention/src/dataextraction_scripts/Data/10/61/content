  Graeme Wood. "Re-Engineering the Earth." The Atlantic. September 12th, 2010 : "The scariest thing about geo-engineering, as it happens, is also the thing that makes it such a game-changer in the global-warming debate: itâ€™s incredibly cheap. Many scientists, in fact, prefer not to mention just how cheap it is." 
 Many people will be needed to participate in the field. Jobs could be as diverse as geoengineering itself, testing methods and implicating them. And, with the economy currently in a recession, this new field could really create new jobs in a world where there are fewer every day. New jobs and innovations could lead to more new fields and more jobs.
 Many geoengineering approaches are exorbitantly expensive. Launching mirrors in to space, or Spraying ocean water into low flying clouds, or putting seeds in to clouds to manipulate the weather, and spraying sulfer into the air are all incredibly complicated, resource and technologically intensive, and ultimately expensive. Launching mirrors would be the most costly, spraying ocean water is the least expensive. 
 Manipulating the weather might have odd effects, and letting sulfur into the air would cause acid rain which would hurt the forests, animals, and people alike, all which have major and  real  economic costs.
