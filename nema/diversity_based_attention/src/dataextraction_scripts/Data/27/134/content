 Reality entertainment is based on display of sex, violence, humiliation, bad habits, and other - on TV - morally unacceptable behaviour.
 Not only that reality shows as such are immoral, but watching them is even worse. People crave humiliation of others, especially if they themselves relax in front of a screen.
 There is nothing immoral about reality shows, but rather about the society which demands them. These shows are just a product of our values and desires.
 Even if reality shows were immoral, it is always our free choice whether or not to watch them.
