 In scripted shows, everything that happens does so for a specific reason. In reality shows, people act spontaneously, which can easily result in violence, bad language, or other socially undesirable situations.
 Precisely because reality shows are not scripted, they reflect the reality the best, as they are not a product of someone's imagination.
