 In fact, there are many reality entertainment programmes that educate people. Either directly (how to build a house), or indirectly (it is moral to help others in need).
 Reality shows educate people by displaying disastrous consequences of someone's behaviour, thus deterring others from doing unplanned and silly actions.
 Even if reality shows were not edifying, they generate huge revenues that can be used for funding more sophisticated programmes. Take BBC, for example. It offers entertaining reality shows such as Total Wipeout as well as brilliant documentaries.
