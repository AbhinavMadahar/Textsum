 Reality shows are merely about shameless self-promotion, based on humiliating others, and harm relationships, thus corrode the cultural and moral pillars of our society. No economic benefits can outweigh that.
 Reality shows were designed to make as much money as possible (e.g. through product placement), while contributing next to nothing to our culture. This is clearly detrimental to the society as a whole.
 Advertising, product placement, and other sources of reality TV revenues can be used to fund more "edifying" programmes.
