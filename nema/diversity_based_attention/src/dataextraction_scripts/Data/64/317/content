  David Scheffer. former US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues (1997-2001). "The US and the International Criminal Court Then and Now". Jurist. 16 July 2008  - "In Washington many lost sight of the court’s aim to bring to justice political and military leaders who orchestrate massive atrocity crimes against thousands in lawless regions where national justice fails."
 Countries such as the United States have avoided joining the ICC out of concern for protecting its leaders from prosecution. Yet, the ICC is established only to prosecute the worst war criminals in fairly clear-cut cases. Therefore, unless the US or other countries plan on protecting war criminals in their midst, they have nothing to fear from the ICC.
  John R. Bolton. "The United States and the International Criminal Court". Remarks to the Federalist Society. 14 Nov. 2002  - "We are considering, in the Prosecutor, a powerful and necessary element of executive power, the power of law-enforcement. Never before has the United States been asked to place any of that power outside the complete control of our national government without our consent. Our concern goes beyond the possibility that the Prosecutor will target for indictment the isolated U.S. soldier who violates our own laws and values by allegedly committing a war crime. Our principal concern is for our country’s top civilian and military leaders, those responsible for our defense and foreign policy. They are the ones potentially at risk at the hands of the ICC’s politically unaccountable Prosecutor, as part of an agenda to restrain American discretion, even when our actions are legitimated by the operation of our own constitutional system."
 National governments that oppose the ICC, such as the United States, are not attempting to protect guilty nationals, but preserve their national sovereignty to try these individuals.
