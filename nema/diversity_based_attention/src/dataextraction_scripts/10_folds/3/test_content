 Manipulating the weather might have odd effects, and letting sulfur into the air would cause acid rain which would hurt the forests, animals, and people alike, all which have major and  real  economic costs.
 Without cuts to CO2 emissions, Geo-engineering is the last option. Many experts warn that if CO2 emissions aren't cut drastically, then Geo-engineering will be the last option. If it  is  the last and only option, the international implications would be that if nothing is done, the Earth would be doomed, so it is very likely that, internationally, Geo-engineering solutions would be accepted widely. 
 For instance, planting artificial trees that act like a vacuum - sucking the CO2 out of the air - could be one of the solutions that are used internationally. This, painting the tops of rooftops white, and other innocuous solutions are entirely uncontroversial and will not cause international tensions of any kind.
  Jamais Cascio. "It's Time to Cool the Planet." The Wall Street Journal. June 15th, 2009 : "the deployment of geoengineering would lead to international tension. Who decides what the ideal temperature would be? Russia? India? The U.S.? Who's to blame if Country A's geoengineering efforts cause a drought in Country B?"
 It’s a worldwide decision. What if a country doesn’t agree or doesn’t think it’s a good idea? This is such an intractable problem, it probably makes the most sense to avoid geoengineering all together. 
  Alan Robock. "Has the time come for geoengineering?" The Bulletin. August 14th, 2008 : "The United States has a long history of trying to modify weather for military purposes, including inducing rain during the Vietnam War to swamp North Vietnamese supply lines and disrupt antiwar protests by Buddhist monks."
  Brandon Keim. "6 Ways We’re Already Geoengineering Earth." Wired. March 23, 2010 : "Scientists and policymakers are meeting this week  to discuss whether geoengineering to fight climate change can be safe in the future, but make no mistake about it: We’re already geoengineering Earth on a massive scale. From diverting a third of Earth’s available fresh water to planting and grazing two-fifths of its land surface, humankind has fiddled with the knobs of the Holocene, that 10,000-year period of climate stability that birthed civilization." And, if we are already geoengineering the Earth in negative ways, why not do it in ways to counteract the harm we've already inflicted?
 These include adding sulfur to the atmosphere (similar to volcanoes) and iron fertilization of algae blooms in the ocean (mimics same effects of sand storms carrying iron out to see off of West African coastlines). For moralists, this should provide some comfort. These are not purely man-made inventions; but often are inspired by nature itself.
 Indian environmentalist, scientist, philosopher and eco-feminist, Vandana Shiva: "it is the idea of being able to engineer our lives on this very fragile and complex and interrelated and interconnected planet that’s created the mess we are in. It’s an engineering paradigm that created the fossil fuel age, that gave us climate change. And Einstein warned us and said you can’t solve problems with the same mindset that created them. Geoengineering is trying to solve the problems with the same old mindset of controlling nature. And the phrase that was used, of cheating—let’s cheat—you can’t cheat nature. That’s something people should recognize by now. There is no cheating possible. Eventually, the laws of Gaia determine the final outcome." [4] 
  Alan Robock. "Has the time come for geoengineering?" The Bulletin. August 14th, 2008 : "16. Military use of the technology. The United States has a long history of trying to modify weather for military purposes, including inducing rain during the Vietnam War to swamp North Vietnamese supply lines and disrupt antiwar protests by Buddhist monks.19 Eighty-five countries, including the United States, have signed the U.N. Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD), but could techniques developed to control global climate forever be limited to peaceful uses?"
 David Victor, the director of Stanford University’s Energy and Sustainable Development Program: "It may be we never use this option, but it needs to be ready." 
 Some research companies and organizations, such as NERC (National Environmental Research Council) are in favor and support research behind geo-engineering. National programs, such as the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) view geo-engineering as a viable way to deal with Climate Change. (NERC-  [6] , EPA-  [7] ) 
 There is the possibility of devastating long term effects if natural cycles or processes are interrupted or thrown off by geoengineering techniques. If the balance of nature is upset, it could result in natural disasters such as drought, famine, or extreme weather situations brought on by sudden changes in the composition of the atmosphere. All natural disasters cause disruption in the political system of a country. Money has to be expended to try to minimize the loss of life, research has to be paid for to find out what caused the disaster and what could prevent it from happening in the future, and politicians will have conflicting and ever changing ideas about what should be done and to what extent, and who should be doing it. While the government is scrambling to solve these problems, other important issues are pushed aside in its wake.
 That may be true but religion all around has caused some of the most high death tolling wars in history such as the crusades. Religion may preach peace but tends to promote fighting amongst people of different religions.
 If religious institutions have some inherent flaws, certainly this favors atheism on many levels as an alternative. 
 Communism is the perfect form of government in a perfect society. Human greed and ignorance caused those flaws in dictators and such. There is no tenant in atheism that says we must conquer or convert. Unlike the Christian or Muslim religions.
 There is no credible evidence to support the claim that Communism "was invented by atheistic idealists who wanted a perfect society without God's help. So it follows that it was necessary to wholly rely on fallible humans to attempt to achieve their goal." Communism is a sociopolitical and economic world view and is not based on attempts to manipulate society without the assistance of a deity. That some commmunists are atheists proves nothing. Some Christians are communists.
 The claims in this section are a mish-mash of irrelevancies. Even if Hitler were motivated by evolution (to the extent that anything even approaching the scientific theory evolution were endorsed by the Nazis at all, it is the discredited beliefs of Houston Stewart Chamberlain who explicitly rejected Darwinism), evolution is not atheistic. The majority of people who accept evolution are religiously inclined. 
 Yes, the idea of theocracy may describe a perfect society, but what good is a perfect society if it doesn't exist and all attempts to create one fail miserably? 
, which it unquestionally did with regard to the holocaust, ignores the fact that the majority of Nazis were Catholics, that the Catholic church collaborated with the Nazi state to the extent of organising the escape of defeated Nazis to South America, that Hitler and the Nazis regularly (even if they did not actually personally believe it themselves) claimed that they were acting in accordance with God's will and with his blessing - the belt worn by non-SS soldiers had upon it "Gott mit uns" ("God with us"), and many senior Nazis endorsed some form of paganism. The Nazi government neither blanket endorsed or repressed religion both according to personal belief and political expediency. It was certainly not an athiestic government.
 Religious Institutions have helped many people do things they otherwise could have not such as quit smoking, stop drinking alcohol, and help many convicted felons turn a new leaf. They also have many volunteer programs within them and are an all around good place to make friends and have fun.
 The actions and beliefs of religious institutions are irrelevant to the debate of whether or not Atheism is a sound philosophy, as well as to the issue of evidence for or against God. An idea or philosophy is true or false apart from any institution, organization, or person that may claim to believe or follow that philosophy. One must look at the worldview in question and from that decide whether it fits with what we see in the universe. 
 The crusades which the atheists have mentioned in this debate were started by the Catholic church in an age when they were notorious for their corruption. When you criticise religious institutions, judge them by their scripture- in this case the Bible. The Bible says that the Jews are God's chosen people and would never support a war like the crusades where so many Jews were killed. The Catholic church were ignoring the Bible and so cannot in this situation be called true Christians. Therefore you can't say that the crusades happened due to Christianity.
 Communism, the ideology providing the ground for so many brutal dictatorships throughout the last century, was mainly followed by atheists.
 It was invented by atheistic idealists who wanted a perfect society without God's help. Karl Marx, probably the most influential man with regard to the founding of communism, is well known to have been very critical of religion, famously calling it "the opium of the people". Lenin also hated religion. So it follows that it was necessary to wholly rely on fallible humans to attempt to achieve their goal. Every Communist society in history has been at least mildly repressive and all have been proven to be corrupt, with most caring little for human rights. Yes, the theory of Communism may describe a perfect society, but what good is a perfect society if it doesn't exist and all attempts to create one fail miserably?
 In Communist prisons many Christians were subjected to vigorous brainwashing with the intent of killing their faith, and many were also tortured in other ways. Our opponents in this debate have claimed that atheists make no attempts to convert, but this is clearly not true. For more on this topic please see  Debate: Evangelism  to debate whether evangelism is in itself ethical, if humane methods are used and no one is  forced  to convert, only encouraged.
 Take the Second World War, which was caused partly by Hitler's belief that the Germans were superior, a result of his belief in Evolution. The Nazi government was repressive of religion (see  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany , and see the section headed "Nazi policy towards Churches"), and arguably Germany's main opponent in the war, the USSR, was likewise repressive of religion.
 Just because you believe in a just God doesn't mean you are automatically expected to be perfect. Most humans are theistic and since all humans are sinners, most sinners are theists also. But just because a religion's followers are fallen does not mean that the religion itself is automatically disproven.
 A tree is a tree, a table is a table - A is A. Man's reasoning mind is his only means of survival. And therefor, he  can only take facts of reality as truth. Or, to put it another way, wishing won't make it so. Religion advocates the premise of an omnipotent, omniscient, mystical being - a being whose only definition is that he is beyond man's power to conceive.
 Reason is man's only means of survival. For example, if a hungry person needs food he must use his reasoning mind to establish the best method of obtaining food, and then act upon his decision. If he ignores his mind and preys for food, he will starve - and that is a fact of reality. Existence exists independent of man's mind, or to put it simply, A is A. Every argument for god's existence is fundamentally floored. As is the phrase: "you can't prove god doesn't exist." First of all, you cannot be called upon to prove a negative. How can somebody disprove a concept if there is no evidence to support it? Again, to put it simply, observe the following conversation: Person X - "I just observed two pigs flying while you were looking the other way"; Person Y - "That's impossible"; Person X - "I did, I just seen two flying pigs"; Person Y - "Prove it"; Person X - "Disprove it".
 Another fallacy, which should be understood by those who advocate an omnipotent, omniscient, mystical father figure, who contradicts every law of nature, and who destroys mans mind by faking reality, should note this: a person achieves, he thanks god. a person fails, he blames himself. Do you see where this leads? 
 Even assuming the theological premises of religion are valid, the epistemological basis for divine gnosis, cannot be communicated free of interpretation and bias.  In contrast knowledge obtained through empirical evidence is communicable as the skeptic can independently repeat the observation or analysis of data.  If wisdom exists in the social proscriptions of a given religion's dogma then that wisdom can be empirically verified.  On the other hand if "the message" has been altered or misunderstood by "the messenger" then in obedience to religious authority pious society does not question the validity of the claims through empirical means.  Thus flaws remain which lead to unjust persecutions and unnecessary conflicts such as jihad's, witch trials, and inquisitions.
 Once we needed gods or deities to explain our world and to give us some hope of purpose. God is a trap for lazy people who find it easier to have someone think for them. Science has explained many of the processes of the universe that were once gods. God also provides humanity (in their vanity) a special purpose beyond that of other life. Our arrogance caused us to believe we are special so we created God and an afterlife.
 Morals and right and wrong come directly from religion. If a person has no religion, then there is no standard of personal morals other than what feels good, or what they want to do. Religion provides a basis on which to build a meaningful life. 
 The author fails to provide evidence for this statement, and daily life and common sense both show that this is not a sound statement.  According to the argument that follows under the initial premise, if one believes in God then he ought to be starving to death: “… if a hungry person needs food he must use his  reasoning  mind to establish the best method of obtaining food, and then act upon his decision.” Because people who believe in God “reject reason” the author is saying that those people must be either dead, starving, or have someone feeding them, which is obviously not the case. The fact that “existence exists independent of man’s mind” does nothing to advance the initial premise. Finally the author spends time stating that one cannot prove a negative, which is true, but does nothing to promote the initial premise of “If you believe in God, then you reject reason.” 
 Even if one assumes the foundational theological premises of religions are false, competing religious beliefs about proper personal and social behavior acts as a social "genetic code".  Societies and sub-societies in the past  prospered in a virtual form of natural selection based on the amount of wisdom encoded in their religious doctrine.  Examples of "unclean" foods and practices which predate scientific knowledge of germs, suggest similar social wisdom may be encoded in religious proscriptions.  Until and unless we fully develop a rigorous, empirical science of social behavior, and evolve non-religious disciplines and institutions to serve this role we should not lightly dismiss religion based social wisdom.
 This is because of our easily corruptible nature- which history has shown. With no leader society falls into chaos and anarchy, with weak, frequently changing leaders we fall into a process of dithering politics and slow moral decline, and with corrupt dictators we are subjected to human rights abuses and restrictions of freedom of speech etc. But God cannot be corrupted. Those who follow him will not be treated badly by him but will still be able to maintain their moral standards. God is the only hope for humanity, those who reject him reject humanity's last hope.
 The Bible itself denounces laziness, especially in Proverbs and also Paul says "If a man shall not work he shall not eat." True, not all theists are amazingly hard working, but the same can be said of atheists also.
 The idea of sport is to compete your natural ability, and drugs are very bad for athletes. The use of performance-enhancing drugs leads to serious health problems, including “steroid rage”, the development of male characteristics in female athletes, heart attacks, and greatly reduced life expectancy. Some drugs are also addictive. With these results in mind, one must seek to eliminate and discourage the use of drugs by most athletes. We cannot condone wrongdoings for balance.
  Matthew Herper. "The Case For Performance-Enhancing Drugs In Sports." Forbes. May 20th, 2011 : "the most obvious solution has always been to legalize those drugs that work, and to experimentally monitor new entrants, including dietary supplements, for both efficacy and safety. Biological improvement would be treated much as athletic equipment like baseball bats and running shoes. This could improve both athlete’s performance and their health, and would be a lot better than having everybody trying whatever additive they can sneak, attempting to stay ahead of drug tests, and trusting anecdotes as a way of measuring safety and efficacy."
 Pentagon, hardly a symbol of peace, has been rebuilt. Twin towers weren't. The message that this sends to the public is hardly positive.
 Actually, the currently planned status of the WTC site is one giant advertisement for the success of terrorism.
 The whole facade could be partitioned to squares, which could hold either a  decent collection of static pictures  or - better yet - large digital screens, like those on the Times square. The best place for those advertisements would quite naturally be the places of impact of the aircrafts. Furthermore, the observation deck(s) on the rebuilt towers would imaginably become rather attractive location for various public gatherings.
 The best memorial for the victims of 9/11 and the ensuing wars would definitely be rebuilt Twin Towers, not two uglish pits.
 The Twins should be reconstructed (somehow), since the new testament speaks of rebirth.
 Twins just were integral part of the city. It's just too impractical not to rebuilt them (in some form), too costly. Or 9/11 itself was not enough (for us) - we have to cut ourselves even more. Even though we have computers and communicate through them, there are other means of communication. When the Twins were destroyed, New York was struck at its core, certain behavioral schemes were abolished. A city, a civilization is like a living organism. One cannot live with(out) fundamental organ(s) taken out.
 After WW2, whole cities were rebuilt.
 The Towers looked like a giant number 11. Built in the end of sixties and beginning of seventies, with some finishing touches added shortly thereafter, they were not exactly new. They felt down because they could not withstand the heat of fire, which spread rather quickly inside them. They were attacked on the 11th of September. 2001.
 Rebuilt ones would be no substitute for the original. You just cannot rebuild things.
. The omnipresent presentation of the Twins as symbols of America goes directly against this commandment, as would the reconstruction. 
 The rebuilding of the WTC would cost only a fraction of the expenditures already spent on the War on terrorism, not to mention the cost of wasteful bailouts.
 Immoral content, erosion of cultural values, enhancement of stereotypes, and other possible harms are innate to a huge number of scripted shows, not to mention websites.
 Reality shows are merely about shameless self-promotion, based on humiliating others, and harm relationships, thus corrode the cultural and moral pillars of our society. No economic benefits can outweigh that.
 Reality shows were designed to make as much money as possible (e.g. through product placement), while contributing next to nothing to our culture. This is clearly detrimental to the society as a whole.
 Advertising, product placement, and other sources of reality TV revenues can be used to fund more "edifying" programmes.
 In fact, there are many reality entertainment programmes that educate people. Either directly (how to build a house), or indirectly (it is moral to help others in need).
 Reality shows educate people by displaying disastrous consequences of someone's behaviour, thus deterring others from doing unplanned and silly actions.
 Even if reality shows were not edifying, they generate huge revenues that can be used for funding more sophisticated programmes. Take BBC, for example. It offers entertaining reality shows such as Total Wipeout as well as brilliant documentaries.
 Reality shows gradually erode our doubts about possible harms of surveillance. We are becoming used to being watched for the pleasure of someone else, which could lead to a total indifference regarding surveillance.
 Surveillance is nothing unusual in today's world, especially if you consider security cameras and checks. This surveillance, however, is justified, because it protects human lives and property.
 Reality shows were designed for people to laugh at stereotypes, which (unconsciously) enhance these beliefs, although participants usually come from extreme backgrounds or are told to behave in extreme ways.
 Shocking reality shows are valuable, because they force the society to think about stereotypes, taboos, and biases. Subsequently, if these problems are brought into spotlight and discussed, we move towards solving them. Moreover, it erodes our hypocrisy of closing eyes to these issues.
 Reality shows help us let off steam and relax, which - after all - is one of the main purposes of television.
 People can decide freely for themselves, what they consider entertaining.
 Scripted amusing shows are much better, because they usually offer higher quality entertainment, as reality shows are based on sexual, xenophobic, chauvinistic or any other morally less acceptable humor.
 Reality entertainment is based on display of sex, violence, humiliation, bad habits, and other - on TV - morally unacceptable behaviour.
 Not only that reality shows as such are immoral, but watching them is even worse. People crave humiliation of others, especially if they themselves relax in front of a screen.
 There is nothing immoral about reality shows, but rather about the society which demands them. These shows are just a product of our values and desires.
 Even if reality shows were immoral, it is always our free choice whether or not to watch them.
 In scripted shows, everything that happens does so for a specific reason. In reality shows, people act spontaneously, which can easily result in violence, bad language, or other socially undesirable situations.
 Precisely because reality shows are not scripted, they reflect the reality the best, as they are not a product of someone's imagination.
 Even science can't prove that God doesn't exist. The Bible could not have been created out of nothing, by nobody. Alike in the case of the creation of the world. The God is the creator of the world. 
 There is good evidence that God exists and there are good arguments for accepting religious beliefs. The fact that we live in a beautiful, orderly universe in which human beings exist and have special moral and spiritual awareness points clearly to the existence of a divine Creator behind the universe. Billions of people have had religious experiences of one sort or another - all of them revealing the existence of divine reality - the only good explanation of this fact is that the divine reality is really there.
 Science and religion have more in common than atheists care to admit. What we accept as scientific theory about how the universe came into being, is just as absurd as the notion of an intelligent being willing it to happen. 
 There is no need to prove faith or God's existence. It is just the same to attempt to prove the existence of love. It exists, although it cannot be fully described or proven.
 The law of conservation of matter and energy states that the total amount of all the matter plus all the energy in the universe can never change, though matter can be changed into energy and vice versa, and that neither can be created or destroyed. However, at the Big Bang all of the matter and energy in the universe was  created , which naturally leads us to the assumption that  the Big Bang must have been caused by something which was not subject to these most basic laws of physics, and is therefore almost certainly not subject to any of them - why should it comply with some but not others? If this thing was not subject to the laws of physics, then there is no reason why it should be subject to them now. Being superior to the laws of physics also suggests that  this thing must be eternal and unchanging  since decay and change only take place on the physical plane. Of course, the Judaeo- Christian view of God complies easily with these concepts and is therefore the most rational explanation of our existence.
 A first cause is necessary for the universe make sense. We make no apology for replying with "no one" to atheist's favourite question "Who made God?". There must have been a first cause and it is God who is the most reasonable candidate for this, especially in the light of the arguments detailed in the previous paragraph.
