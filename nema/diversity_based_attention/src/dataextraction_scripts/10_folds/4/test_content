 Religious belief is completely irrational. There is no evidence that God exists. Reported miracles, healings etc. are never reliably proved actually to have happened, and in any case everyone’s religious experiences are different and point to the psychological differences between human beings not to any objective divine reality. Belief in God is simply wish-fulfilment. It would be nice if there was a loving all powerful being watching over us, but there isn’t.
 Given the length of time the Bible was written over, it is understandable that atheists will assume it contains contradictions. If it didn't, it would be inconceivable that such a high degree of harmony between the different authors over the ages could be explainable by any means except divine inspiration. The alleged contradictions and the refutations of them would take ages to go into detail here, so here's a link to a website which covers these topics in sufficient detail for those who are interested:  http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/bible.htm 
 This debate does not cover any other material claiming to be Christian scripture, including the Apocrypha and the Book of Mormon. As far as translations are concerned, we only defend the original Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic- if we were to go purely by the translations, they would potentially contain many errors and contradictions, but we contend that these do not exist in the original.
 The year of the re-emergence of Israel as a nation was predicted in the Bible, as well as many other things such as the European Union, the euro, and possibly also the atomic bomb and satellite television. Christ's life was described in great detail by the prophets centuries before the events happened, and many of these events can be verified by sources outside of the Bible. It is obviously highly unlikely that such prophecies were not divinely inspired.
 for a list of prophecies that have been fulfilled as well as other evidences for biblical inerrancy.
 The definition of "spam" (in the electronic sense at any rate) is "unsolicited or undesired email messages" (from Wikipedia).
 If they were, why do they often have such a heavy warning tone- especially the ones predicting the invasion of Israel and Judah by the Babylonians and Assyrians-which also came true?
 Opposite was an argument detailing a prophecy made by Jesus which was seemingly false because that generation died before all of the signs of the end of the age had occurred, however, the footnotes of the NIV translation of the Bible mention that the word translated as "generation" could also be translated "race". Problem solved. 
 Take the messianic prophecies- if they had been vague the Jewish people would not have understood them so well to the point where they were longing for the coming of the Messiah (especially after the Roman occupation).
 Christ's life was described in great detail by the prophets, and many of the fulfilments of those prophecies could not possibly have been arranged by a con man. How could Jesus have chosen his town of birth, betrayal price, his method of execution (crucifixion was a execution method that no one in their right mind would chose, and dying on a tree as prophesied was in Jewish tradition viewed as probably the most ignominious way to die), his betrayer, that he would be mocked, spat on, wounded (but without breaking any bones) and would have his clothes gambled for in the lead up to his death? 
 Other "prophets" such as Jeane Dixon, Edgar Cayce, and Nostradamus have a large following, and many claims have been made as to the accuracy of their predictions, however, many of their predictions failed to come true, and also the ones that did come true were either very vague/ self-fulfillable in comparison to the Bible, or were made too close to their fulfilment and at a time when the odds were easily stacked in their favour. For a lengthier comparison between these false prophets and the Bible, we again point to bibleevidences.com.
 The con side have claimed that there are no outside-of-the-Bible verifications of fulfilments of Biblical prophecies, however, the prophecies concerning Tyre in Ezekiel 26 and 27 are verified by secular historians, for instance, over the site where Tyre once was, fishermen now often spread their nets, as foretold.  
 When Jesus talked about his second coming the New Testament, he mentioned that at the moment he comes, some will be asleep while others awake and working, hinting that Jesus knew that the world was not flat so that there could be day and night at the same time, ages before this fact was discovered.
 It is highly improbable that this narrative was not divinely inspired as the chances that the author of Genesis (probably Moses) could have guessed everything correctly is pitifully small.
 Our opponents have dismissed the premise as not counting as scientific knowledge, but now everyone knows that the Earth is not flat. They also dismiss the conclusion, giving a list of other possible sources of this scientific information for these Biblical sources, but if they feel that the Bible is too far fetched, then how much more are their alternatives! Do they believe that they exist yet God does not? If so, why?
 See  Debate: Evolution  for arguments concerning the scientific validity of macroevolution.
 The Dead Sea Scrolls were written a millennium before the earliest copies of the Old Testament Texts corresponding to it that had previously been discovered, but the documents were almost 100% the same, with what differences that were there being insignificant.
 and did not rely on word of mouth to be passed from one generation to the next because there is evidence to support the claim that there was a Semitic alphabet already in use in Moses' day, so the authors of each book of the Bible will have been able to write. 
 Plastic shopping bags take thousands of years to break down and thus they are harmful for the environment and deadly for the sea life. Every year, billions of plastic bags are used and thrown away. Plastic bags are NOT made from a renewable source and we are wasting tons of resources every year with plastic bags. A lot of plastic is used to make the billions of plastic every year and usually isn't recycled. Using plastic bags as bin liners is not really recycling because you throw them away once they are filled with rubbish.  Every year Australia alone uses over 6 billion plastic bags and over 80 million end up clogging up the streets, drains and parks.  [1] 
 Banning plastic bags would save plastic, but add to the environmentally harmful production of paper and cloth. We do still need something to put shopping or rubbish in and if we stop using plastic for the bags, we'll start using another resource which will be bad for the environment such as paper or cloth. We do need plastic.
 If each plastic bag cost - say, 10 cents, then people would not use them in large amounts because they are paying. If someone shopping twice a week, using six plastic bags each shop, and the bags cost 10c each, they would realize that that would cost over $60 a year so they would either not use as many, OR this may be an incentive to reuse plastic bags.
 It would be a fair intention of the Government to start charging a small fee but the amount is so small, it's not really fair to charge that fee anyway, but people will just buy the bags if they have to. It will not deter most people and most people will just pay the money.
 Nearly all supermarkets get provided plastic shopping bags for free. It is really not fair for supermarket chains to profit up to 50c a bag when they are used in very large numbers and they get the bags for free.
 The main use of plastic bags is to carry shopping in. Getting rid of plastic bags would just mean that we would need to find a replacement for them. That is easy - we just need to use reusable cloth bags or paper bags and that is the problem solved. Plastic bags do have a practical replacement.More than that Jute bags have emerged a successful replacement of plastic Jute bags.The Govt. of Himachal Pradesh (a hill state of India which is also a tourist hot spot) has banned plastic completely for over 3 years now. The transition has proved successful and now shopping bags are more reusable, sturdy and beneficial.
 There are too many uses of plastic bags to be able to get rid of them. Plastic bags are used as bin liners - you cannot replace bin liners with another type of bag - it is not efficient and even worse for the environment. Banning plastic bags would just see paper bags clogging up our waterways. Plastic bags are handy to have and are an important part of our lives.
 - Face-to-face learning is very important for many reasons, such as emotional impact, group work, and real-world lessons, among others. Distance learning misses out on all of these advantages. This is a major limitation to online distance learning.
 - People are spending far too much time on their computers today, writing emails, IMs, and generally missing out on important opportunities to build interpersonal skills. These skills are very important in the business world. Performance in interviews, in social settings, and in face-to-face meetings suffers as a result.
 - Tools like calculators, for example, are used at the cost of understanding the underlying theoretical pretexts of the match that is being performed.
 - Multiple studies draw this conclusion.
 - While there may be an infinite array of possible learning avenues via tech and online tools, there is also end infinite array of possible distractions, including such things as IMing, Facebook, and other destinations that could be considered distractions from real learning. 
 - Multiple studies draw this conclusion. While does not necessarily indicate that technology is bad for education it may indicate that it "adds little".
 - Core values are taught in inter-personal, inspirational interactions, which are sacrificed by the presence of technology.
 - Communicating via writing all day over the Internet is not an effective way to advance important interpersonal skills.
 - Anyone with a computer can get online today and gain access to an endless array of knowledge. Such individual access and potential is unprecedented. 
 - With modern technology, students can participate in a variety of new and dynamic ways. 
 - Technology is not simply a forum for presenting existing knowledge, but becomes fundamentally part of the creation of new knowledge and, thus, the substance of that knowledge itself. Superior knowledge can result. One compelling example is Wikipedia. 
 - Technology does no good for education in the third world without accompanying schools. Many third world countries don't even have schools and teachers. This is a more important start than introducing technologies. 
 - Technology enables those with limited access to higher education to connect with and learn about the wider world. While many third world `countries do not have internet access, this is slowly changing. With such changes, the opportunities for access to world's of information are infinite.
 - Interest groups and businesses are shaping the direction that technology is taking in the classroom. This systemic problem means that the interests of students and teachers are not necessarily at heart, which inhibits the ability of technology to add to education.
 - The principal argument being that educators spend a lot of money on new technologies, opposed to more traditional elements of education.
 - This argument focuses primarily on the economies of scale that new technologies introduce in education, helping cut the costs of various tasks, transfers of information, transport of individuals and so-forth.
 - The fundamentals of teacher training, teacher-student interaction, curriculum, and proper funding remain the most important elements of education. Technology is merely a tool around these more fundamental elements of education. 
 - Teachers and students should interact in a face-to-face, interpersonal manner. This leads to true connections and inspirations being made. 
 - Making good teachers through improved teaching-method study and instruction should be the focus of attention. This is fundamental, and adding technologies may distract from it.
, rather than just acting as a conduit to existing knowledge.
 Let's face this. Educators don't have the ability to give a holistic education. Their qualifications in a certain subject determines their capabilities. But can he or she relate the subject that he or she masters, effectively, with other subjects that he or she isn't able to master? This is a holistic education. Technology can make an impact in this regard. For example, software can store as knowledge complicated information that exceeds the memory of a human being, in this case, educators. Such software can be used to assist teachers in giving a more holistic education.   
 as every country tends to have at least a bit different position. Because of lesser likelihood of making unanimous decisions quickly enough to effectively address the problem, the NATO's capability of action would shrink.
 Efforts should be concentrated in the area of improving UN's political and military power such that it can ensure the security of member states.
 If more people choose covenant marriages, it simply proves that they reject the looser moral values of the liberal establishment. It would be unconstitutional for the government to discriminate in favour of one form of marriage over another, and in practice most people will have no idea what kind of marriage their neighbours, and other kids’ parents have.
 Couples planning to be married will face pressures from each other, their families, their ministers, and society at large to choose a covenant marriage. The traditional marriage will therefore be seen as a second-best option. One result of this is that many couples who would not have freely chosen a covenant marriage will feel forced into one. 
 A 1991 Justice Department study concluded that current husbands/fathers account for only 9% of the cases of domestic abuse. The rest of the abuse was perpetrated by former husbands, boyfriends or transient partners. Without divorce, women may be less likely to be involved with abusive men. [2] 
 In a covenant marriage, a partner must prove that abuse actually occurred to be permitted to end the marriage. This especially worries advocates for battered women who say that proving domestic abuse can be difficult and the waiting period makes women stay in abusive relationships longer. In addition, mental abuse is not seen as a legitimate reason to end a marriage. [3] 
 In 1968, the year before California adopted the nation’s first no-fault divorce law, the US had 584 000 divorces (2.9 per 1 000 Americans). After 30 years of no-fault divorce, the number of divorces had reached 1,135,000 annually. Covenant marriages are the answer. Research has shown that 33% to 45% of couples on the brink of divorce may reconcile if they are legally prevented from divorcing for six months as specified in a covenant marriage.
 The US Supreme Court ruled more than 50 years ago that the state of residence at the time of the divorce determines the laws governing the divorce. So if the covenant marriage partners move to a state without covenant marriage laws, they are free to use the no-fault system anyway. This makes for a likely weak covenant marriage system.
 They lose stability and security. Children whose parents have divorced have higher rates of suicide. They are more likely to commit crimes and abuse drugs. Their education suffers, and they are less likely to graduate from college and more likely to drop out of high school. The detrimental financial effects of divorce also affect these children. Children of divorce must adapt to many changes in their family environment and are at greater risk of being abused. The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers summer 1997 newsletter says, “Only acts of war and the events of natural disasters are more harmful to a child’s psyche than the divorce process.”
 Research shows that when parents stay in a high-conflict marriage, children fare worse than when their parents actually divorce. Children must be considered when parents divorce, but with appropriate nurturing and support, children can cope with divorce and eventually have strong marriages of their own. In fact, studies show that a child of divorced parents is no more likely than a child of married parents to divorce as an adult. And after all, until the twentieth century, mortality rates were such that many children experienced losing a parent while still young and having to adjust to their surviving parent’s remarriage.
  George W. Bush, in his 2005 State of the Union address, declared , "Because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace." [4] 
 (for the year 2005). The last available Polity ranking for the year 2003 states "Foreign occupation". Syria controlled much of the politics in Lebanon until the Cedar Revolution in 2005 and regime after that is less than 3 years old. The Lebanese general election, 2005 after the Cedar Revolution has been described as "free but not fair" by the newspaper Washington Post. The different religious groups are allocated parliamentary seats not proportionate to the number of voters. The whole public sector is similarly divided. Everyone from the President and the Speaker of Parliament down to police and college professors are chosen according to the individual's faith.
 The Lebanese general election, 2005 has been described as free, credible, fair, well managed and peaceful by United Nations observers and its Security Council. The electoral law was accepted by all major parties, although there is also agreement that it needs to be reformed. Allocation of parliamentary seats according to faith is in accordance with the principals of consociationalist democracy as advocated by Arend Lijphart.
  James Bovard. "The Democratic-Peace Fraud". The Future of Freedom Foundation. 23 May 2008  - "The notion that democracy will end all mass killings implies that there is some nobility latent within the masses that merely requires a change in the process of selecting a nation’s rulers to blossom. That would hold true if the only reason people sought blood was that they had not picked their own chiefs. The history of mobs does not indicate that popular selection of leaders ensures nonviolence."
List of possible exceptions to the democratic peace theory - Wikipedia  "Yugoslavia did not fulfill the criteria for a liberal democracy. Frequent and arbitrary changes of election laws and districts occurred, even retroactively after elections. Press freedom greatly restricted. Slobodan Milosevic's regime controlled the state television and radio broadcasts. Electoral manipulation including: massive double voting, "voting" of persons being permanently absent or deceased, the pressure on employees by the management of ";socially owned companies", organized planting of already prepared voting ballots into the polling boxes, forging of electoral records and election board records, alteration of the election results made by electoral commissions, the large-scale annulment of the election results by courts rulings, and changing the number of participating voters in order to fulfill the legal requirements for the validity of the elections."
List of possible exceptions to the democratic peace theory - Wikipedia  "Slobodan Milosevic, the leader of Serbia, won several elections. The NATO nations participating in Operation Allied Force were democratic. At time of Kosovo War, Milosevic's party was in a coalition with two others, and the Serbian Parliament contained a broader range of political parties than is common in nations such as America, Britain and Japan. The government had invited the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe into Serbia to judge on 1996 election fraud, and had accepted its rulings even though they went against Milosevic's party.Milosevic had made election of Yugoslav president into a ballot by the whole electorate rather than just by the legislature."
 This means that the war followed the democratic peace theory?
 This means that two democracies were at war, showing an exception to the democratic peace theory.
  "Freedom, Democracy, Peace; Power, Democide, and War". Hawaii.edu  - "It is true that democratic freedom is an engine of national and individual wealth and prosperity. Hardly known, however, is that freedom also saves millions of lives from famine, disease, war, collective violence, and democide (genocide and mass murder). That is, the more freedom, the greater the human security and the less the violence. Conversely, the more power governments have, the more human insecurity and violence. In short: to our realization that power impoverishes we must also add that power kills."
  Martin Wolf, Why Globalization Works?. Yale University Press. 2004. ISBN 0-300-10777-3. pp 33. - Liberal democracy does not only have domestic virtues. It is also the only system of governance for which harmonious and co-operative inter-state relations are a natural outcome. This important proposition was put forward by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant in his tract Perpetual Peace. Liberal democracies may fight with other states, but have no reason to fight with one another. When Norman Angell, the British liberal, wrote in his subsequently derided masterpiece, the Gran Illusion, published in 1909, that a war among the great powers could only prove mutually ruinous, he was correct...Liberal democracy is conducive to harmonious international relations because the prosperity of a nation derives not from the size of the territory or population under its direct control, but from the combination of internal economic development with international exchange. The insight is the heart of Adam Smith's  Wealth of Nations . It was not just a point about economics, but an equally original and important point about international relations.  Mercantilism  - the view that the aim of trade is the accumulation of treasure - was worse than bad economics. It was also lethal politics, because it led to conflict where conflict was unjustified."
  James Baker III  - "We believed that the defeat of communism and the rise of the democrats created an unprecedented opportunity. We hoped to build our relations with Russia, Ukraine, and the other new independent states on the basis of democracy and free markets: what we came to call a "democratic peace," the type of peace we enjoyed with Germany and Japan. This peace would be based on shared democratic values, not just converging interests. While the democratic impulse in Russia and in most of the new independent states of the Commonwealth was genuine, these nations had little in the way of democratic traditions, and we were far from certain that democracy would take root. But we did not want to create a self-fulfilling prophecy by pursuing a pure balance-of-power policy that assumed from the outset that these states would eventually return to authoritarianism." [1]

 Imagine you are visiting an aquarium that features a large shark tank. There are 100 sharks in the tank. Ninety-five of the sharks are either docile or too small to injure a human. There are, however, five hungry great whites. Certainly, the overwhelming majority of the sharks are harmless, but would you swim in that tank? Similarly, we should not ask, are democracies peaceful?, but is the United States peaceful? Are the other militarily powerful democracies – United Kingdom, France, India, Israel, peaceful? History shows they are not. See, Figure No. 6. As Gowa writes, "Theory suggests and empirical studies confirm that major powers are much more likely than are other states to become involved in armed disputes, including war."
  Sebastian Rosato. "The Flawed Logic of Democratic Peace Theory". The American Political Science Review. Vol. 97, No. 4 (Nov., 2003)  - "Open political competition does guarantee that a democracy will reveal private information about its level of resolve thereby avoiding conflict."
  James Bovard. "The Democratic-Peace Fraud". The Future of Freedom Foundation. 23 May 2008  - "Other democracies also lack pacifist resumes. Britain, which was a constitutional republic that became increasingly democratic as the 20th century wore on, attacked many nations to expand or defend its empire. Since the government of Israel was established in 1947/48, it has attacked Egypt (1956), Egypt and Syria (1967), and Lebanon (1982–2006), as well as engaging in more than 35 years of armed struggle against the Palestinians living in the occupied territories seized by Israel in the 1967 war. It also engaged in a defensive war in 1973 against Egypt and Syria.
 Ethnic groups often vote in specific patterns. In this way, voting can highlight and foment divisions between ethnic groups, leading to violence, civil war, genocide, or even regional war.
 Authoritarian regime not respecting civil and political liberties. Poorly functioning democracy in Ethiopia.
