God does not exist.
There are no contradictions in the original text of the Bible.
In this debate, we're defining the Bible as the Old Testament from Genesis to Malachi and the New Testament from Matthew to Revelation.
The fulfillment of numerous Biblical prophecies proves that the Bible is inspired by God.

Please take note also that the biblical prophecies were NOT intended as poetry, as the con debaters have suggested.
No Biblical prophecies have so far failed to come true.
The prophecies relating to Israel and the Messiah were obviously seen at the time to be relating to Israel and the Messiah.
The messianic prophecies can also be used to demonstrate that Biblical prophecies are not self-fulfilling.
Biblical prophecy is of a superior degree of accuracy to predictions from non- canonical sources.
The fulfillment of Biblical prophecies has been verified in many cases by external, secular, and neutral sources.
The Bible implies to the modern reader that Jesus knew the true shape of the Earth, a fact that none of his contemporaries had guessed.
The Genesis account of creation describes the same order of events of the creation of the Earth as modern science does, a remarkable and peerless achievement when compared to the haphazard guesses of other creation stories written in that era of history.
That the Earth is a sphere-like geoid is a well established, scientific fact.
For a lengthier explanation of the correlation of the Genesis account of Creation with the order of arrivals of species suggested by modern scientists, read the first chapter of Dr E.K Victor Pearce's book "Evidence for Truth: Science".
The Bible text is unchanging.
The Bible is not Chinese whispers,
Banning plastic bags would be good for the environment.
We still need something to put our shopping in.
Charging for plastic bags would deter people from using them in large amounts.
That wouldn't do anything to help the environment.
It is not fair for supermarket chains to profit from something they get for free.
There is an easy, practical replacement for plastic bags.
Plastic bags have so many practical uses.

Teachers should be determining the role of technology in education, not profit interest groups
Technology adds to the cost of education
Technology reduces the cost of education
Technology is merely a tool facilitating education

As NATO has to take make all decisions unanimously, any future enlargement would decrease the likelihood of consensus 
The United Nations (UN) should already provide the needed security guarantees for non-NATO countries.
No one is going to be forced to have a covenant marriage, but it should be available to people as a choice.
If covenant marriage is given legal status, it will rapidly become a forced norm.
Covenant marriage might eliminate the problem of X husbands abusing their former spouses.
Abusive marriages may be prolonged by covenant marriages.
Passage of no-fault divorce laws resulted in an onslaught of divorce and a breakdown of the American family, and covenant marriages can help resolve this.
Covenant marriage laws are weak.
Covenant marriages are good for children because the make divorces less likely, and divorces are bad for children.
Covenant marriages force families in conflict to stay together, which has the potential to harm children more than divorce.
 Spreading democracy and "peace" is used as a pretext for war

 Ethnic voting in Democracies often stokes ethnic violence
There were no elections in Eritrea before the war.
Both countries were technically democracies
Democracies are founded on similar principles so they should not go to war.
 Democratic peace theory is insignificant
