rory mcilroy could benefit from tiger woods playing in the masters .
paul mcginley feels mcilroy needs woods to help ease expectation .
victory at augusta would secure mcilroy his first green jacket .
` rory was favourite , but all the expectation , all the talk , was focused on tiger , ' mcginley feels , remembering last year 's us pga .
