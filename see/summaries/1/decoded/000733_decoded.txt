photographer richard john seymour 's `` yiwu commodity city '' photo project began in january 2014 .
the shopper 's paradise , in the city of yiwu , covers 46 million square feet and has about 62,000 booths , with 100,000 suppliers exhibiting 400,000 kinds of products .
the sheer enormity of the place posed challenges for london-based seymour , who visited commodity city twice last year .
