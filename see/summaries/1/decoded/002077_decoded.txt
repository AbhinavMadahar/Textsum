wilfried zaha was happy to take one for the team after the crystal palace winger was involved in a nasty collision .
the 22-year-old slid in at the back stick to turn home yannick bolasie 's low cross knowing that he was on course to crash into the upright .
zaha 's momentum took him and puncheon crashing into the post as both palace players required treatment .
