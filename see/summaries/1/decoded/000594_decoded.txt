the first state visit to the united states of afghan president ashraf ghani and chief executive officer abdullah abdullah was supposed to take place in early march .
but the visit was delayed because republican leaders had invited israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to address congress during the same time period .
ghani is clearly uncomfortable with the pace of this u.s. troop withdrawal .
