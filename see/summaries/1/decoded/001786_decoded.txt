flam , a cat in nashville , tennessee , may well be the first of its kind to have a conversation with a human being .
but sadly , as documented on video , the little chat did n't go down that well with the feline .
in the clip is penny adams , a professional photographer who volunteers her time at the cat shoppe rescue centre .
