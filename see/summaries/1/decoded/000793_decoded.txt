conrad hilton , the younger brother of paris hilton , has reached a plea deal .
he would admit guilt to misdemeanor assault against flight attendants in exchange for a federal felony charge being dropped , court papers say .
the deal would require prosecutors to recommend probation for hilton , who also allegedly called passengers `` peasants '' on a london-to-los angeles flight last summer .
hilton , 20 , is scheduled to appear thursday in federal court .
