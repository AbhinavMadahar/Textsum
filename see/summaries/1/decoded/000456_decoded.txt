frida ghitis : during the three years that i was serving as a member of tunisia 's constituent assembly , i would frequently walk to work through the gate of the bardo museum so i could get a glimpse of the mosaics , and perhaps enjoy the adjoining herb garden .
the museum , in downtown tunis , serves not only as a physical reminder of tunisia 's roman , jewish , christian and islamic heritage , but is also connected to the tunisian parliament .
