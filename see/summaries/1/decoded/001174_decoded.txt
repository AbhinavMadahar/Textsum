frida ghitis : i 'll be the first to admit that a fellow pilot would use an airplane for his demise and the demise of his passengers .
it is my hope that there is more to this uncanny , horrific tragedy than just an extraordinary suicide event .
although a report of normal breathing from the co-pilot in the moments before the crash indicates that he was not incapacitated , how can use an airplane for his demise and the demise of his passengers .
