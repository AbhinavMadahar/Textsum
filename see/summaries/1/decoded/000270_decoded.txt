the corpses , some of them beheaded , were found in a shallow mass grave under a bridge just outside the nigerian town of damasak , near the border with niger .
troops from niger and chad took back the town from boko haram last week during a joint operation .
damasak is in borno , one of several northern states inhabited by the islamist militant group .
