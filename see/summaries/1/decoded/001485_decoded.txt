the football association were criticised following the last two under-21 european championships in denmark -lrb- 2011 -rrb- and israel -lrb- 2013 -rrb- for failing to prepare properly and that was shown by results , as they failed to win any of their games at those tournaments .
this time , the fa have no intention of repeating such mistakes and that is why gareth southgate will take the under-21s to olomouc in a fortnight for a training camp .
