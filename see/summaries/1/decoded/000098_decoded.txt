melissa was sold into the sex trade by a family member when she was only 12 years old .
her life became a prison : chained to a bed in a warehouse , she endured regular beatings , rapes and once was even set on fire by her captors as she was forced to serve 5 to 30 men every day .
the problem is n't confined to one part of the country .
