andy murray led a 15-year ban after being found to have taken several banned substances , including steroids , in out-of-competition tests carried out in december and january .
the severity of the ban for the 29-year-old world no 267 owes itself to odesnik already having been given a two-year ban .
murray later beat adrian mannarino 6-3 , 6-3 at the bnp paribas open and will face spain 's feliciano lopez in the quarter-finals .
