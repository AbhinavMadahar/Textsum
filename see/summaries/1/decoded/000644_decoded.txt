solar impulse 2 has landed safely in oman on the first leg of its quest to be the first plane to fly around the world .
the solar-powered plane took off from abu dhabi in the united arab emirates early on monday .
the journey was expected to take about 12 hours , but high winds of up to 11 knots delayed its landing .
