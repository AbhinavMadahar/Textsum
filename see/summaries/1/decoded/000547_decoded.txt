sen. ted cruz , the conservative firebrand from texas , became the first republican to announce his campaign for the presidency .
he spent monday morning telling a crowd at the largest christian university in the world to imagine what the country will be like when he takes office .
cruz drew on the past only to focus on the future , repeatedly and emphatically asking the liberty university student audience to `` imagine '' the u.s. under conservative leadership .
