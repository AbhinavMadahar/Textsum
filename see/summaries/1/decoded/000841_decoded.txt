frida ghitis : wednesday 's terrorist attack , which killed 23 people , hit tunisia where it hurt by targeting its flourishing tourism industry .
the deadly attack on the prominent bardo museum near tunisia 's capital , tunis , is the latest instance of an armed assault carried out by gunmen willing to fight to the death , a tactic that has been widely adopted by jihadist terrorists in recent years .
such attacks mimic the 2008 mumbai assaults in which 10 gunmen from pakistan went on a rampage in the massive indian port city .
