councillors voted that the new ` no parking ' traffic markings in auchenblae , kincardineshire , are to be painted a pale shade of primrose so as not to detract from its historic charms .
residents branded the idea ` mad ' and voiced fears that the new lines would be ignored because people would n't know what they mean .
this will be the first time double yellow lines have been introduced in the village as residents have objected to them in the past , given its picture-postcard appeal .
