the original chauvet cave is famous for its 36,000-year-old art , which dates back to prehistoric times and is believed to be the oldest in the world .
in order to recreate the cave and its drawings with accuracy , 3-d modelling was used and some 6,000 digital images were overlapped in developing sketches .
an expansive replica of the chauvet-pont-d'arc cave is scheduled to open to the public soon in southern france .
