spanish neuroscientists claim low alcohol red wine produces more brain activity in ` taste processioning ' areas , then stronger tipples .
while the low alcohol bottles may not contain more flavour per se , people pay more attention to ` fruity bouquets ' and ` woody notes ' so the wine appears to be tastier .
