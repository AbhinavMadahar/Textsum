jakub moravec , 37 , had travelled from his home in the czech republic .
but he was lucky to escape with minor injuries to his arm , chest and face after the attack .
the remains of a polar bear , which attacked mr moravec on spitsbergen island , are one of only two places on land where the eclipse will be fully visible .
