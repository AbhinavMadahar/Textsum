almost half of all eight year olds and a third of children aged five have fillings or teeth missing because of tooth decay .
furthermore in 2013 , 46 per cent of 15 year olds and 34 per cent of 12 year olds had ` obvious decay ' in their permanent teeth .
while high those figures do represent a slight reduction over the course of a decade , when the comparable figures were 56 per cent and 43 per cent respectively .
