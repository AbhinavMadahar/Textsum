a 17-year-old girl who was forced to undergo chemotherapy testified monday at a closed door hearing where she and her mother are seeking her release from state custody .
the teen learned recently that her cancer is in remission and she is no longer fighting the treatment .
but she and her mother are asking to end her custody by the department of children and families -lrb- dcf -rrb- so she can go home now instead of waiting until the chemotherapy is complete next month .
