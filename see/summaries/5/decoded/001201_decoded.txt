crippled by a devastating stroke , mrs inglefield was left paralysed , unable to cuddle her newborn son or help care for her young daughter .
at the age of just 38 she woke up away from her children on a specialist stroke ward .
it was the thought of looking after her new baby jamie , and his big sister serena , who was 16-months-old at the time , that gave her the motivation to get better .
