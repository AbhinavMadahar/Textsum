the white house blasted senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on monday for holding up the confirmation of president obama 's nominee for attorney general .
the verbal strike on mcconnell came after the republican legislator said over the weekend that he would n't allow a vote on new york prosecutor loretta lynch 's confirmation until the senate passes a once bipartisan sex trafficking bill that democrats are now refusing to support over a provision limiting funding for abortions .
the spat is the latest indication that the respective goodwill professed by the white house and numerous veto threats .
