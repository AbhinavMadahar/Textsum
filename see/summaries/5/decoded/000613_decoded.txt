archaeologists at yale university in new haven , connecticut , have developed a way of diagnosing the disease in skeletons thousands of years old .
scientists have used the technique to reveal that infants and toddlers found in a cemetery within an ancient roman villa in italy had died of the disease .
the method could now be used to track the spread of malaria back to its first appearance in humans by examining other ancient skeletons for signs of the infection .
