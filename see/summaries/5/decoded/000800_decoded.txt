the famous walkway - known as the most dangerous in the world - is set to reopen to the public .
the narrow gorge in the province of malaga , el caminito del rey is a precarious walkway that rises over 100 metres -lrb- 328ft -rrb- above the river below .
the original trail was built to provide construction workers with access to hydroelectric power plants in chorro falls and gaitanejo falls .
the pathway was shut in 2001 after five people lost their lives while negotiating it between 1999 and 2000 .
