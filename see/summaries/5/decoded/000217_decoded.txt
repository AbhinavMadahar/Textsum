kelly and anna cooke , both 34 , have chosen to buy sperm from denmark .
they want their child to have blonde hair and blue eyes and because british sperm ` does n't cut the mustard ' the married couple used kelly 's eggs for the insemination after receiving # 300-a-time vials of danish sperm in the post .
anna is now pregnant and they are expecting their baby in late july .
