barbaric islamic state militants have dealt yet another blow to christian history in iraq by using explosives to destroy the 4th century mar benham monastery .
the ancient building , built by assyrian king senchareb 1,600 years ago , stood in the christian-dominated town of bakhdida , just 20 miles south east of bakhdida , just 20 miles south east of oil rich isis stronghold mosul .
locals took to social media to share images of the massive blast , which reduced the ancient monastery to little more than vast piles of rubble .
