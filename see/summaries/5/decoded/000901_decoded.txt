andrew chan and myuran sukumaran will be heard in jakarta court on thursday .
it comes after friday 's news that andrew chan and myuran sukumaran 's executions have been indefinitely delayed due to ongoing legal proceedings .
the delay and new appeal have been welcomed by the pair 's legal team , as well as foreign minister julie bishop , both of whom have voiced their optimism at the prospect for a repeal to the execution sentence .
the new appeal will be the men 's second challenge to the clemency bid which was rejected in january .
