yvette cormier says she was undressing at the planet fitness in midland when she realized ` there was a man ' in the change room .
the 48-year-old went to the front desk to alert them , however staff informed her the person was transsexual and was allowed to be in the locker room .
when cormier pressed ahead with her complaint , the gym said she had violated their much-touted ` no judgement zone ' policy and canceled her membership .
