more than a dozen state institutions have ` adopted ' a stray dog , which is then issued with an official state identity card bearing its photograph name and where it lives .
five of the dogs live at old havana 's museum of metalwork and regularly patrol the streets after hours .
when not patrolling , each of the dogs can be found sleeping underneath the institution 's grand stairway .
