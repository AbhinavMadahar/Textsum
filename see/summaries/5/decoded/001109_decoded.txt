the solar impulse 2 plane , covered in 17,000 solar cells , is making its way around the world on a five-month trip to highlight the benefits of solar technology .

when the device is fully charged on solar power it has enough energy to charge an iphone three and a half times or fully charge an ipad mini tablet .
