raif badawi was arrested in 2012 for offences including insulting islam , cyber crime and disobeying his father -lrb- a crime in saudi arabia -rrb- .
last year , the father-of-three was sentenced to 10 years in jail , a fine of 1 million riyals -lrb- $ 266,000 -rrb- .
his punishment also meant he would be flogged 50 times every friday for 20 weeks - but after the first beating in january this year , these have been postponed each week on medical grounds .
