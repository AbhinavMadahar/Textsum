the united states has evacuated its remaining 100 special operations members from yemen .
this due to the country 's deteriorating security situation , as was witnessed on friday when four suicide bombers in explosive vests killed 137 and injured hundreds more when they walked into the badr and al-hashoosh mosques .
isis has since taken responsibility for the attack , but it is still not confirmed if they were in fact behind the bombings .
further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between president mansour hadi and the houthi rebels .
