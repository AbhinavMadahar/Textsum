shots were posted on social media by russian troops from military unit 46108 , the 5th tank brigade , based in buryatia , which lies between lake baikal and mongolia in the far east of siberia .
a keen-eyed blogger has used them to help prove these soldiers have been fighting and dying very far away from there in eastern ukraine - something vladimir putin has always denied .
they back up the account of a 20-year-old tankist who claims he was hurt fighting in a civil war .
