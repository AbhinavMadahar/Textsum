16-year-old kyle longmore from tasmania achieved the amazing feat .
the broad-bill swordfish weighed more than three times heavier than kyle .
he caught it using only 24kg fishing line off tasmania 's east coast .
kyle was onboard his friend leo miler 's 7m boat choonachasa .
` the worst moment was when it got closer to the boat , ' says kyle .
