rachel abbott and her husband bought 15th century monastery in 2000 .
all that was left of the monastery was chapel -lrb- minus the roof -rrb- and oratory .
near the hilltop town of treia , in italy , it cost the couple only # 150,000 .
but a two-year restoration project set them back a further # 1 million .
building survived until 1960s , enabling architects to recreate original style .
but behind the facade , it 's a modern eight-bedroom home with seven en suites and a swimming pool .
