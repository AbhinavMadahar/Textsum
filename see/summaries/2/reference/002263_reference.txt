juan mata joined manchester united from chelsea for # 37m last january .
the two-time chelsea player of the year ran riot at anfield last sunday .
louis van gaal used mata as a ` false right winger ' against liverpool .
right-back antonio valencia covered to allow mata to abandon his post .
since the start of the 2011-12 season , mata has more goals and assists in total -lrb- 65 -rrb- than any other midfielder in the premier league .
only david silva -lrb- 365 -rrb- beats him in chances created since 2011-12 , but mata -lrb- 291 -rrb- has played 466 fewer minutes than the manchester city player .
david moyes never got his money 's worth for mata but van gaal can .
