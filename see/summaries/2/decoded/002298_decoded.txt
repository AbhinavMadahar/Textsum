england will go into next week 's game against france with a fighting chance of winning the six nations but they will be annoyed with themselves for leaving so many points out there on the field .
it 's all going to come down to points difference , and its nip and tuck with ireland , but those points england left out there at twickenham could cost them dear .
the biggest positive i would draw out of the game is that there was plenty of creativity .
