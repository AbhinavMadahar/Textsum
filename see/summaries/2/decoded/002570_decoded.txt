saturday night live pushed the envelope this week with a parody of a car commercial that had a young girl joining isis , and not the us army , at the end .
the segment was laid out the same as the recent my bold dad spot in which a father tearfully drops off his daughter to join the military in his toyota camry .
the spot that first aired during the 2015 super bowl and was seen as a touching look at what it is like to say goodbye for those that have family members .
