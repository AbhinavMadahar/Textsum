arsene wenger has branded leonardo jardim a liar after the monaco coach accused the frenchman of a lack of respect following arsenal 's exit from the champions league .
jardim , whose side beat the gunners on away goals in the last 16 of the competition , said wenger left for the changing rooms early rather than shaking his hands after the ligue 1 side 's 3-1 win at the emirates stadium in the first leg .
