andy sullivan 's bid to qualify for his first major championship ended in emphatic fashion on friday .
sullivan needed to win his third european tour title of the season or finish alone in second to climb into the world 's top 50 before monday 's deadline to secure a place in the masters in a fortnight 's time .
the 28-year-old from nuneaton could only add a 75 to his opening 74 in agadir , with his hopes extinguished courtesy of a quintuple-bogey nine on the par-four fourth .
