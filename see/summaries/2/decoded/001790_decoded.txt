the grey seal pup was filmed as it made several attempts to climb aboard the canoes in poole bay , dorset .
at first the adorable seal tries his best to jump on both the kayaks , but he keeps sliding off , back into the water .
the pup , known locally as ron the seal , finally succeeds by draping himself across both of the kayaks .
