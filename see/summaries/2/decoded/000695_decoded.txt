lewis hamilton , the winner of sunday 's australian grand prix , has told formula one 's cynics that the rules of the sport should not be ripped up to slow him down .
the world champion was replying to red bull team principal christian horner , who called on the fia to limit the superiority of hamilton 's mercedes team to make the season a more even fight .
horner 's view was supported on monday by bernie ecclestone .
