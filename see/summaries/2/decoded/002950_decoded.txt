the amber room - valued at around # 250million in today 's money - was looted from the palace of peter the great in soviet russia by invading nazi troops in 1941 .
it is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing art from world war two never to be found and has captivated treasure hunters ever since it was first plundered .
some say the panels were destroyed by soviet artillery fire on the prussian city of koenigsberg .
