amateur photographer christian kneidinger has travelled to some of the most beautiful locations in the world , but his camera-shy wife was not keen to make the family album ... luckily he had his teddy to step in .
the album was put together after wife ranati , 51 , refused to be featured in any holiday snaps , but the couple still wanted a personal touch on the landscape pictures .
