arsene wenger is still haunted by the game which was in 1999 , another fa cup tie , a semi-final .
it was at villa park , with 90 minutes of a replay having failed to separate the two teams that then dominated english football in that era .
united were down to 10 men and dennis bergkamp had missed a penalty for arsenal in the final minute of normal time .
