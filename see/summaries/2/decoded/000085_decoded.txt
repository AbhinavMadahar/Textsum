serena williams cruised into the third round of the miami open on saturday .
the two players had failed to get on court on friday due to the weather but the delay did not distract the top seed and she claimed a 6-3 , 6-1 victory to set up a clash with cici bellis .
williams had withdrawn from the semi-finals of the bnp paribas open last week with a knee injury .
