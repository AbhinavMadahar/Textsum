the walls around the base of this property , just outside the polish capital of warsaw , are clad with mirrors - even if its design does make it tricky to find .
the mirror house has been deliberately designed to minimise its impact on the stunning forest surroundings .
parts of the ground flood of this building , near warsaw in poland , almost appear as an extension of the forest floor .
