hollywood star russell crowe has done little to dampen speculation about his possible interest in buying sky bet championship club leeds .
the 50-year-old oscar-winning actor and lifelong leeds supporter sparked rumours he was keen to invest in the club last month when he asked a fan on his twitter site whether it would be a good idea to buy them .
crowe did not deny or confirm the speculation of potential investment .
