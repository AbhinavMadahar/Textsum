ten boeing 787 dreamliners have been sitting unused and unwanted at a boeing factory in everett , washington .
the abandoned and half-completed aircraft have been labelled the ` terrible teens ' after being relegated during the early stages of production after numerous structural and weight issues .
as a result the teens , which were among the earliest designs to be built , were made too heavy to fly as far as manufacturers had hoped .
