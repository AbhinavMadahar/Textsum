the duchess of cambridge was pretty in purple as she attended the goring hotel 's 105th birthday celebration in london today .
she 's not the first pregnant star to have sported the flattering erdem frock .
back in september 2012 , yahoo! ceo marissa mayer , 33 , who is seven months pregnant , wore a similar dress from the same resort 2013 collection .
