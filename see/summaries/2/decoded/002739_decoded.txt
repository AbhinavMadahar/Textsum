a reduced-fare program has launched for commuters in seattle 's metropolitan area offering transit tickets based on income .
the orca -lrb- one regional card for all -rrb- lift program provides a discounted rate of $ 1.50 per trip for residents using public transportation earning less than 200 per cent of the federal poverty rate .
as the metropolitan area 's metro fares increased for the fifth time since 2008 today , the program was created with the hopes that public transit would remain accessible for those who can not afford the higher prices .
