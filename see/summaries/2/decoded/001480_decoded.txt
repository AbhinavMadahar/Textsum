stephen hendry has won a five-year battle with his neighbours to build 11 luxury homes in the back garden of his mansion .
the seven-times development was originally given the go-ahead in 2012 but construction never started because of the decline in the housing market .
renewed plans were submitted to perth and kinross council last month by mr birnie 's company craigmount developments and they have now been given the green light .
