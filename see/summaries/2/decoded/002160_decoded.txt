ufc president dana white was forced to hold featherweight champion jose aldo and conor mcgregor apart as the pair faced-off ahead of their ufc 189 main event bout .
mcgregor was certainly the more agitated party as he faked a punch towards aldo before attempting to force his way past white .
aldo has held his title since 2010 when ufc merged with the old world extreme cagefighting organisation .
