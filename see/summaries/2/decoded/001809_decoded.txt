the pilot , who was captured near jabal al-zawiya in idlib province , is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi abdullah al-muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle .
al-muhaysini , who has long been affiliated with al qaeda-linked groups in syria , suggests the life of the airman will only be spared if the syrian regime releases notorious jihadi abu mus ` ab as-suri , who is wanted in spain for suspected links to the 1985 el descanso and 2004 madrid bombings .
