jessie tuckman , originally from macclesfield , cheshire , was living in a luxury city centre flat and working as a loan and mortgage broker in manchester .
but , in 2012 , the adrenaline junkie gave up the lot and moved more than 300 miles away to cornwall with just # 150 to her name to chase her dream of becoming a surfer .
the 26-year-old - who had n't even touched a surf board until she was 20 - now spends eight hours every day surfing off the coast of newquay .
