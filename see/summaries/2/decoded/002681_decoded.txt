the secret service has become the site of two new security breaches that took place just hours apart , sparking lockdowns at the presidential mansion .
on sunday night , an unnamed suspect stepped over a bike rack situated outside the white house fence .
the bike racks were installed last year following a high-profile fence-jumping incident that involved an army veteran armed with a knife .
early monday morning , another person attempted to walk through a gate while a construction crew were leaving .
