scientists at university of tübingen , germany , grew bacteria on magnetite .
one species of bacteria harvested electrons from the mineral and another dumped electrons back on iron in the mineral at night .
the amount of energy stored is too low to be used as a new power source .
but other species may create stronger charges for natural batteries .
