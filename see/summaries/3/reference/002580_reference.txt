engineers say spacecraft travelling that fast would hit photons of light .
this would cause interstellar aliens to leave light signatures in their wake .
but travelling so fast means there will be significant drag from photons .
a collision with a single dust grain would release energy equal to 5291lbs -lrb- 2,400 kg -rrb- of exploding tnt .
