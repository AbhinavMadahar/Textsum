two bottled beers were recovered from a shipwreck in 2010 .
schooner was found off the coast of the Ã…land islands , finland .
initial taste tests said beers were ` vinegary , goaty and tasted of sour milk '
this was caused by bacteria that had grown in the bottles over the years .
but chemical analysis of the samples revealed specific flavours .
these include ` green leaf ' flavours , sweet apple and rose compounds .
this makes them similar to modern lagers and ales rather than stouts .
