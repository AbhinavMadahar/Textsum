in 2012 , françois hollande 's socialist government introduced painful new charges on british second home owners .
a mandatory , 15.5 per cent ` social contribution ' was introduced on both capital gains and rental income .
this meant that britons were paying into two social security systems , and effectively being taxed twice .
the european court of justice has ruled that this violated eu law , meaning that thousands of britons are in line for substantial payouts .
