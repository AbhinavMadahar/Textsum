sarah , 87 , is retired and lives in chigwell , essex with her sister , joan , 84 .
she says turning 40 has helped her feel less downhearted about ageing , going grey and being more critical of her appearance .
but today turning 40 , is no longer a harbinger of middle age but for many it 's just another phase of our ever extending youth with all the anxieties of opportunities .
