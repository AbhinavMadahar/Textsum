scientists at the european space agency have restarted efforts to listen for a signal from the stricken lander on comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko .
they lost contact with the washing-machine sized spacecraft in november last year after it bounced several times before landing in a hollow below a cliff .
starved of the sunlight it needed to power its suite of experiments , the lander 's batteries went flat after around just 60 hours on the surface .
