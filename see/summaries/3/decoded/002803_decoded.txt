anne frank likely died a month earlier than previously thought meaning there was little chance of her surviving the holocaust .
it was previously believed that the jewish teenager , who was sent to the bergen-belsen concentration camp , died of typhus on 31 march 1945 , two weeks before the camp was liberated .
however a new study puts the date of her death at some point in mid february , meaning that even if british troops had reached the camp a little sooner , she would likely not have survived .
