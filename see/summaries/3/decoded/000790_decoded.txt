a court heard she knew the 42-year-old would n't see the trap due to the hallway light being out and she was left with serious injuries to her face , neck and back .
judge rajeer shetty described the incident as ` malicious and pre-meditated ' and today handed pearson a 12-month jail term , suspended for two years .
