the old town hall in sheffield , which housed the city 's crown and high court until the 1990s , has lain dormant since 1996 .
but its public gallery , benches and dock are still intact , giving the appearance of a building frozen in time .
the grade ii listed building 's glory has faded over the years but remnants of its role as a council chamber and court are still visible among the decaying timber and rotting carpets .
