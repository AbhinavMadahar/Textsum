scientists have discovered one small population of people living in a remote part of the andes in north west argentina .
they have found that over thousands of years the local inhabitants there have developed a genetic ability to metabolise the arsenic to reduce the impact it has on their bodies .
worldwide arsenic poisoning caused by contaminated water and food is thought to harm more than 137 million people .
even low levels of arsenic poisoning can cause damage to the lungs , heart , kidneys and liver , leading to cancer .
