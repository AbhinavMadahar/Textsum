juliet stevenson was treated like a saint while filming a biopic on the nobel peace prize winner mother teresa in the slums of india .
as she passed through the slums , locals dropped to the ground believing the nobel peace prize winner had been brought back to life to care for the poor .
the biopic will be released this year in the hope it coincides with mother teresa 's canonisation .
