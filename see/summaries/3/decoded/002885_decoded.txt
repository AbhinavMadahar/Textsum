bil malbon , 59 , came up with the idea for building the chapel on wheels after stumbling across a website dedicated to building tiny houses .
the tiny chapel built by retired minister bil malbon , which he plans on taking on the road , offering cut-price wedding services to couples .
the chapel even features a retractable spire , which can be removed when the building is on the road .
