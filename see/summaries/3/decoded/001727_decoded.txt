new york state supreme court justice william garnett ruled on thursday that the grand jury record would remain under seal .
he rejected arguments by the new york civil liberties union and others that the public had a right to know why jurors refused to indict the officer in spite of the video .
he wrote that the law required the plaintiffs to establish a ` compelling and particularized need ' to release the grand jury minutes .
