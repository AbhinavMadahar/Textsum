rosetta has captured a selfie of its shadow on comet 67p in what is the highest-resolution image to be taken by the probe .
the image was taken during a valentine 's day flyby when rosetta passed just four miles -lrb- 6 km -rrb- from the surface of the icy comet .
the glow causes the shadow to be fuzzy and somewhat larger than rosetta itself , measuring approximately 65ft by 165 ft -lrb- 20 by 50 metres -rrb- .
