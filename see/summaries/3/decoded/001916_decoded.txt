david neuman was named last april by aspiring actor and model michael egan , 31 , as one of a number of men who he alleged sexually abused him when he was 15 at various l.a. pool parties and during two hawaiian vacations in 1999 when he was 17 .
egan and his lawyer jeff herman held a news conference to make their graphic claims , but the case quickly fell apart and by june they had been forced to withdraw their allegations against neuman .
neuman is now suing both egan and her lawyer jeff herman .
