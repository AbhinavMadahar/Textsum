kevin franklin got a friend to put up the huge festive display on his council house after he suffered a stroke in november .
he stopped turning them on in january but said they helped calm his autistic son bradley , 15 , and plans to switch them back on for autism awareness month in april .
despite the good cause he has received a poison pen-letter from someone on his street in dunstable , bedfordshire .
