chemical analysis from two bottled drinks found on a shipwreck in finland has revealed their similarities to modern-day lagers .
this includes high levels of ` green leaf ' flavours , sweet apple and rose compounds and a proof of around 3 per cent .
the bottles were found in the summer of 2010 when the wreck of a schooner was discovered in the baltic sea .
