morrisons 's new ceo david potts has scrapped the intelligent queue management system in favour of returning to using humans to decide how many checkouts to open in stores .
the technology , which was introduced in 2008 , used infrared sensors to determine how many checkouts to open by monitoring the number of customer flowing through the store .
it meant that during quieter periods staff could be taken off the tills and placed in other parts of the store .
