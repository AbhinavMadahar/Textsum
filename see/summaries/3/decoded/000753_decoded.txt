horse-drawn beach hut in cornwall has been placed on the market for the first time since it was purchased 92 years ago .
holidaymakers who want to snap up the holiday chalet will have to splash out # 80,000 for the property - compared to just # 10 .
electricity was added in the 1950s , and despite the cramped nature of the hut , it is largely untouched from the time it was purchased for # 10 in 1924 .
