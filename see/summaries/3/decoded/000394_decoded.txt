authorities have arrested a gunman suspected of randomly opening fire on five public places in maryland over the past week .
if the same gunman is behind all the attacks , it would be a case with chilling similarities to the dc sniper attacks of 2002 when john allen muhammad and lee boyd malvo killed ten people with gunfire from a hidden firing spot in the back of their blue chevrolet sedan .
investigators are looking into whether one gunman is tied to the five incidents spread across three different maryland counties .
