jagger died the night after winning a silver medal at crufts .
his owners willem and aleksandra lauwers are convinced he was fed beef laced with slow-acting toxins as he sat on the bench awaiting to perform at crufts as it was the only time he was left unattended .
family vet dr patrick jans said jagger fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died .
