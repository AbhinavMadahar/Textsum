dustin ellermann , a self-taught marksman and avid hunter , is captured on camera applying the rashers of bacon to his gemtech trek 5.56 mm suppressor that rests on the back of a pick-up truck .
either dustin or the video maker mutters under their breath : ` so much america right now ' , before the competitive shooter secures the bacon in place with some tin foil , which is also wrapped around the suppressor .
