jodi arias was convicted in 2013 of killing her lover , 30-year-old travis alexander , but that jury also deadlocked on her punishment .
the deadlock took the death penalty off the table and left a judge to decide whether to sentence arias to life in prison or to life with the possibility of release after 25 years .
that decision is expected at an april 13 hearing .
