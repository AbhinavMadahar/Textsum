anjali damania says leaders should take the initiative to change aap , not simply blog or complain .
letters by admiral l. ramdas and prashant bhushan are the ones that matter , and the issues they raised should be addressed .
it wo n't take more than a month or so for the party to set the system right and not simply raise questions or write blogs .
