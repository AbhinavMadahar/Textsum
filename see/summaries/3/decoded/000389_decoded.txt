firefighting teams and water-bombing aircraft were still trying to curb the spread of the flames sweeping down cape town 's southern peninsula , a mountainous spine of land running from the city to cape point , africa 's most southwestern tip .
it is believed the fire has already ravaged some 4,000 hectares of land - burning the flowering , shrub-like vegetation known as fynbos , part of the unique cape floral kingdom .
the fires started as temperatures soared to their highest for the last 100 years of more than 40 degrees celsius .
