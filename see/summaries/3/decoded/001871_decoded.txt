the city government is selling some 1,700 vacant lots and ruined properties which have gone unclaimed for years - many since the devastation wrought by hurricane katrina in 2005 .
tens of thousands fled the city , never to return , in the wake of the devastating storm , leaving many homes to crumble into ruin , and patches of land to grow wild .
