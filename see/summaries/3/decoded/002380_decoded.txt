the hashtag #facesofprostitution started trending on twitter with sex workers from australia and across the world .
it comes after mamamia published a blog post from christian group exodus cry last week that claimed the 1990 film pretty woman lured women into the sex industry .
it also questioned how many sex workers had been raped , 95 per cent were physically abused and 68 per cent suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder .
