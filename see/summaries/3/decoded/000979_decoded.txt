james yates provided the first world war smith & wesson revolver used to kill the 11-year-old child .
the 27-year-old applied for his exclusion zone to be temporarily lifted so he could visit a relative - meaning he could have been in the area where rhys 's parents steve and melanie jones still live .
mrs jones , 49 , said it was ` awful ' to learn of his application in a letter last saturday - the day before mother 's day .
