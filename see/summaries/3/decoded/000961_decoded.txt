corey knowlton has been granted permission to bring the carcass of a black rhino back to the u.s. as a trophy .
the namibian government issues a small number of licences to hunt the animals with the proceeds used to fund anti-poaching efforts .
they claim the strategy has led to their black rhino population doubling between 2001 and 2012 .
