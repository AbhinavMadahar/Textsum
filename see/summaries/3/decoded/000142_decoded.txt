scientists from the us department of energy and the university of california , berkeley , captured photos of ` ultra-small bacteria ' for the first time .
the photos may end a debate which has been raging for two decades.about whether the tiny bacteria exist or not .
scientists say that the ultra-small bacteria cells have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns which means that almost 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an escherichia coli cell .
