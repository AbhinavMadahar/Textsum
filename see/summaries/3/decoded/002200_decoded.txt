the new york police department is expanding a gunfire-detection system that notifies officers in real time when and where shots are fired .
de blasio said the nypd will deploy the system , known as shotspotter , throughout precincts in brooklyn and the bronx .
the crime center of a police headquarters immediately receives the information , which they can then send out to officers already near the area .
the system has been tested by the nypd since 2011 .
