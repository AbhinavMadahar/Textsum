karie murphy , a close friend of unite leader len mccluskey , was suspended by labour in 2013 and reported to police after allegations that the union had tried to manipulate the selection process in falkirk in her favour .
she was later cleared and had her membership re-instated , but she quit as labour candidate in the scottish seat .
unite now wants miss murphy to be selected in key marginal halifax where the current labour mp , linda riordan , has announced she is stepping down .
