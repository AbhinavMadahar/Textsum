experts want to release lynx , which prey mainly on deer , into woodland in norfolk , cumbria and aberdeenshire as part of an ambitious ` rewilding ' scheme .
although the animals would be introduced onto privately owned estates , the woodland would be unfenced , meaning the 70lb animals could roam free around the countryside .
lynx could be introduced into the uk countryside for the first time in 1,300 years .
