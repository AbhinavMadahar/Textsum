researchers are able to build a 3d picture of earth 's mantle - the layer between the crust and outer core .
they do this by analysing the speed of the tremors , which travel rapidly through solid rock and slowly through molten magma .
computer simulations use the speed of seismic waves from earthquakes to reveal the existence of subterranean structures .
