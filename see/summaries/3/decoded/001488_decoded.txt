yvette caster , 33 , had been single for four years , before she decided to do an experiment where she swiped right to all men on tinder for a week .
it 's a great way of filtering out those you find physically unattractive - just swipe left and they ca n't even message you .
if you like them you swipe right and , if they feel the same , you can chat .
