melanie chiknagi , a former commercial property surveyor from london , developed a new design of baby grow that does not include traditional leg poppers , which she found ` difficult ' to use .
instead , her design , dubbed the picklesuit , features plastic zips on each leg .
it also includes wide arms and non-slip soles from size ' 6 months ' up .
