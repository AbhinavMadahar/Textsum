bbc has denied claims hackers were responsible for its website going offline .
those trying to log on to site at about 1.30 pm today were met with an error screen and an image of the old test card clown after the bbc encountered an internal system failure .
it came just days after the so-called ` hactivists ' reportedly wrote an open letter stating it would use a digital weapon called a ddos attack to bring down the site .
