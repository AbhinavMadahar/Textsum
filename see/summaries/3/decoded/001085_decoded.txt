rob fusari says he now wants another trial in a case in which he was trying to prevent talent scout wendy starland from taking the multi-million dollar cut of the profits he made from gaga .
he claims gaga 's ` highly inflammatory ' words made jury members hate him so much they did n't take the rest of the evidence into account .
fusari , 47 , maintains the judge in a new jersey federal court should never have admitted 28-year-old gaga 's deposition .
