electrical giant currys-pc world has been censured by the advertising watchdog for selling ultra-high definition televisions with bogus promises about extra clarity .
the retailer claimed the smart lg sets with 4k resolution , starting at # 849 , would allow customers to ` watch your favourite christmas movies in greater detail ' the advertising standards authority has ruled that this was exaggerated and misleading because no british tv channel is yet broadcasting in 4k resolution .
