uconn men 's basketball coach kevin ollie is refusing to travel to the final four this week .
ollie , who led his team to the ncaa men 's basketball championship last year , is abiding by a travel ban ordered by connecticut 's governor because of indiana 's new religious-objections law .
governor dannel p. malloy and other critics contend the law would allow businesses to deny service to gays and lesbians based on religious beliefs .
