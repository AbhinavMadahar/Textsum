the supreme court of alabama has ordered the state 's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples in the latest development in a fierce battle over the power of federal law .
in its ruling on tuesday evening , the all-republican court said a previous federal ruling stating that banning same-sex marriage violates the us constitution does not prevent it from following state law .
in alabama , marriage has been legally defined as the union of only one man and one woman for two centuries .
