police have been accused of creating a ` charter for criminals ' with a scheme that allows officers to ignore low-value offences .
the powers mean they can dismiss a crime if the investigation cost outweighs the value of the item stolen or damaged .
victims have been told that unless the stolen object exceeds # 50 in value , police do not have to bother with an investigation .
