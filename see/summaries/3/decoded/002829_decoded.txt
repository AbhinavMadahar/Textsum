british army tanks could soon be allowed to drive at 40mph again on public roads in england and wales .
they had been driving at 40mph since 1977 , until it was realised 18 months ago that defence chiefs had wrongly assumed they were exempt from laws restricting tracked vehicles to 20mph .
the top speed was therefore halved to 20mph in october 2013 to comply with the 1984 road traffic regulation act , but the department for transport is proposing to put it back to 40mph .
