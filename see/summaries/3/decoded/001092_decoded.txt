budi was dying from malnutrition and too weak to move when a british charity discovered him in borneo .
after making a remarkable recovery , an new video shows him interacting - and playing with - and playing with - an equally adorable baby orangutan called jemmi .
they have both been raised by workers at international animal rescue - the charity who care for them - hope their friendship means they will become less dependent on humans .
