the dead men 's eyes prototype was developed by dr stuart eve .
it uses augmented reality to lay virtual images onto the real world .
setup uses the camera on an ipad to see the virtual world on the screen .
this can include anything from a reconstruction of a wall to entire villages .
dr eve has also created a prototype ` dead men 's nose ' device .
this emits odours designed to make the environment smell like it would have done in the past .
