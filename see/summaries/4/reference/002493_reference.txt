joanne higgs , 33 , attacked two girls , aged 13 and 15 .
higgs claims one of the girls had upset her daughter demi knox at school .
higgs was given a suspended sentence of 15 weeks for each assault .
but she has denied she was a ` chav or thug ' and was protecting daughter .
an earlier version of this article suggested that dominique nash had bullied demi knox . we are happy to clarify that ms nash was part of a group of youngsters standing outside a corner shop and came to lilly hulse 's help when she was attacked by joanne higgs , and was then attacked herself . she was not implicated in any playground dispute .
