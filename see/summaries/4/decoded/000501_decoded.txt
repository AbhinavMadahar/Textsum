calais has issued an ultimatum to migrants telling them to remove their belongings and evacuate by the end of the month or be forcibly ejected by riot police .
it comes as the mayor of the port town opened the first purpose built accommodation for migrants since the closure of the notorious sangatte centre in 2002 .
it is believed the french authorities plan to raze the illegal shanty town which has grown up around the town 's ferry port next tuesday .
