the huge rock , called 2014 yb35 , will sail past the planet tomorrow morning at a distance so large it is 11.7 times further than the distance between earth and the moon .
it is estimated to be 1,640ft-wider -lrb- 500 metres -rrb- which would be large enough to cause devastation - but it will not hit earth .
