tomorrow 's total eclipse will produce a 100-mile-wide ` totality ' shadow path that crosses the north atlantic and covers only two land masses , the faroe islands between scotland and iceland .
elsewhere only a partial eclipse will be seen at best and that is why there are only two places on the planet where the real junkies want to be tomorrow morning .
