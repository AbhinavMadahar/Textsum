three watertown police officers have recalled their chaotic gun battle with the boston bombers four days after the explosions that killed three people and injured 264 .
testifying at dzhokhar tsarnaev 's trial on monday , the officers also recounted the terrifying moment he raced towards them in his getaway car - but fatally struck his older brother , tamerlan , as he fled .
the brothers fired a gun at three police officers and hurled bombs at them , including one that was similar to the devices used in the april 15 , 2013 attack .
