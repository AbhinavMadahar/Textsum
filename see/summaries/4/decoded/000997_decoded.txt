a volunteer at the nonprofit barrio dogs spotted a grey pitbull wandering the streets of east houston on march 18 , and noticed a horrifying site when he got close to the dog .
the dog 's ears had been sliced off and it had a stab wound to his head .
cropping ears is sometimes a practice carried out by dog fighters , but it does n't involve taking the full ear off .
