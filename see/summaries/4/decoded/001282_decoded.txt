catherine mcclennan , from ainsdale , southport , claims she was stripped of her responsibilities at the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- following the birth of her third child .
the mother-of-three began working for the organisation , which fights for workers ' rights , in 2006 as a senior manager in the learning and skills section at its liverpool office .
she argued this was discrimination and an employment tribunal in liverpool ruled in her favour this month .
