the two visitors were standing on the arch rock lookout point just before 6 p.m. on saturday when the bluff gave way and the pair fell about 70 feet , winding up covered with rocks and debris .
the national park service put up signs days earlier that warned about a fissure , seen in this undated photo , along the top of arch rock that could have weakened the cliff .
