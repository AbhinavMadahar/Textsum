margaret and gary mazan from bradford , west yorkshire , had their dogs seized by rspca inspectors .
the couple were said to have caused unnecessary suffering to the dogs as they had failed to seek veterinary care for their eyes and injuries to their tails .
three of the fully grown dogs were found crammed in puppy cages and the majority were kept in a squalid garden shed .
