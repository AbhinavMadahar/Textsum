researchers from the university of exeter simulated the effects of street lighting on artificial grassland plots containing a community of invertebrates at night .
they exposed them to two different types of light treatment - a ` white ' light similar to newer commercial led street lighting systems and an ` amber ' light lamp .
the experiments investigated the effects of the lighting on the population density of a species of pea aphid .
