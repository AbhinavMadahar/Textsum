police in memphis have identified 25 rape suspects after finally testing evidence kits that had been forgotten about for 40 years .
some rape victims have sued the city , alleging that the failure to test around 12,000 kits , some dating back to the 1970s , has allowed too many rapists to escape prosecution .
the kits contain samples of semen , saliva and blood taken from a victim , with the dna then uploaded to the fbi 's combined dna index system to check for a match .
