the proposed site in leafy catherine-de-barnes , near solihull , west midlands , will include a total of 3,333 graves for followers of islam .
this is despite muslims accounting for fewer than 3 per cent of the population of solihull and its surrounding areas .
it would mean the cemetery could eventually hold over five times as many people as catherine-de-barnes itself .
