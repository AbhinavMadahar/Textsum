gordon burton , 45 , of newcastle-upon-tyne , agreed to say he was behind the wheel when 14 other motorists were caught speeding , flouting a red light , driving without a seatbelt or using a mobile in the car over a six-year period .
police only became suspicious when it was realised that burton had 49 penalty points on his licence .
drivers are generally banned from the road when they accrue 12 penalty points .
but now , six of the group have been jailed and most of the others given suspended sentences .
