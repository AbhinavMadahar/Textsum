ashley brady , 26 , has had to learn how to walk again after losing her right leg in an accident last summer .
she found a threatening note beneath her windshield after she complained to a neighbor that they had parked in her disabled parking spot .
so she left a note pointing out the error and warning the driver that their car would be towed if they left it there again .
