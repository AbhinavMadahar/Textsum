the most recent complaint has come from adrian chew who was quick to abandon his bolognese recipe after finding a maggot in a jar of remano tomato paste from an aldi store at abbotsford in melbourne .
however , despite the supermarket chain issuing an apology to the couple and launching an investigation into the breach in food safety , more shoppers have begun to come forward with their own disgusting discoveries .
aldi has however apologised to one man who claimed to have found a shard of metal at the bottom of the jar .
