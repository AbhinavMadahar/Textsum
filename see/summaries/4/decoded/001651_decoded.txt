timothy robenhorst , 13 , said ` thank you , i deserved that ' to dad timothy , who surprised him with a run , 60 push-ups and gardening chores at 4am in freezing green bay , wisconsin , after finding out he 'd been mistreating a classmate .
kayden said of the punishment ' i learned my lesson , and he 's a good dad for doing it ' another condition of the punishment is that it remains kayden 's own facebook profile picture and cover photo until robenhorst relents .
