readers donated an extraordinary # 30,000 to animal defenders international .
after the plight of cholita was highlighted by this newspaper last week , readers donated an extraordinary # 30,000 to animal defenders international , which found the bear in a terrible condition during a raid in peru earlier this month .
the elderly bear lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus .
the money raised will allow the organisation to travel more than 600 miles on treacherous mountain and desert roads .
