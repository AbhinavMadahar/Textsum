on mount hengill , the striking ion hotel stands on a craggy outcrop close to where the north american and eurasian plates meet , drifting further and further apart , each year .
boiling water bubbles just 25ft underground here , so when it was built on the site of a geothermal power plant , its creators had to use building materials seven times stronger than standard materials used in reykjav√≠k .
the striking ion hotel is situated on mount hengill , an active volcano whose last eruption was around 2,000 years ago .
