chen tuanzhi was born with congenital genu recurvatum disease , or ` backward-bending knee , ' which left her unable to walk or lie down straight .
her family xiamen , in southeast china 's fujian province , were too poor to pay for corrective treatment so she would use her hands to pull her body along the ground .
villagers even referred to her as the ` crawling girl ' as she could not walk .
she spent months recovering after several operations .
