eco warriors at yorkley built a 20ft high tower as they prepare for eviction by bailiffs .
activists claim the tower is ` an art exhibition ' but a message on their website warns ` we are here , we are determined and we will not leave quietly ' the row began after a group of squatters moved in on the dilapidated land in the forest of dean two-and-a-half years ago and began growing vegetables .
