yassine al-abidi ate breakfast with his family before going to work in a tunis travel agency .
around 10am on wednesday he went on a break and met up with fellow terrorist hatem khachnaoui before the lethal attack .
friends and relatives said that al-abidi did not appear to be a religious fanatic but tunisian authorities said that both men travelled to libya in september for terrorist training .
