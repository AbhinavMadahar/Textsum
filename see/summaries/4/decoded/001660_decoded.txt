connor smart , 18 , and friend jason grant , 17 , had broken into the aberdeen home in the middle of the night where they stole three sets of car keys .
the pair made off with the lamborghini gallardo and a bmw x5 , worth # 60,000 .
but the car thieves lost control of the high powered lamborghini and crashed into a van just two miles away .
the pair denied the offences but a jury of eight men and seven women took just 40 minutes to find them guilty at aberdeen sheriff court .
