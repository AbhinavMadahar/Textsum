marc marginedas , 46 , who was released a year ago , says he and 18 other hostages were guarded by three terrorists .
he says they named them the ` beatles ' because they liked ` beating ' people , not simply because they were british .
leader of the group , who came to be known as jihadi john and has since been identified as kuwaiti-born londoner mohammed emwazi , went on to behead five hostages .
