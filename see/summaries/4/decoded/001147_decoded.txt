video of a visually-impaired samosa street seller in india refusing a generous gift of money from a stranger has gone viral .
the man is left astonished when delhi-based mr pruthia gives him 1000 rupees , saying : ` god sent this for you ' before walking off without waiting for his change .
1000 rupees is around # 10 , and with 40 % of indians earning just 78 pence a day .
