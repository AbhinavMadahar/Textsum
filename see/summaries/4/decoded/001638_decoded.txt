engineers have developed a device that attaches on traditional light switches to enable them to be turned on and off from anywhere in the home .
the developers say the device , called switchmate , means households can benefit from smart lighting without needing rewiring .
the device , which went on sale in the uk this week , is designed to track people 's brain waves , in the same way that fitness trackers count the number of steps a person has taken .
