national puppy day took place yesterday and was easily the most coo-inducing day of 2015 with #nationalpuppyday generating thousands of posts on twitter , instagram and facebook .
even the biggest a-listers were n't immune to sharing a snap of their cute pooch with kylie jenner , justin bieber and ariana grande among those to upload a picture .
the day is also used as a way of encouraging the public to adopt orphaned puppies with celebrities .
