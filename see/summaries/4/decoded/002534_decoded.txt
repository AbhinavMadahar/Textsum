a startup has designed a range of footwear that changes colour and design thanks to flexible e-ink displays built into the sides .
the range also has ` anchors ' on the toe and heel so physical accessories can be added , such as bows , flowers or ankle straps .
inside the shoe 's sole is a bluetooth receiver that connects the displays to a smartphone app .
