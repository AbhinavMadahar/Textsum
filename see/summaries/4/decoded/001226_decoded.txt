australian bat-lovers and conservationists are mourning the loss of an infant flying fox named charlotte .
charlotte , also known as little miss charlotte , was in the care of batzilla the bat , a bat rescue group in brisbane , for a little over a month before the baby bat was found to have liver issues and her carers were forced to have her euthanized .
though the rescue group takes in many orphaned bats , usually rehabilitating them and releasing them back into the wild , charlotte was different .
