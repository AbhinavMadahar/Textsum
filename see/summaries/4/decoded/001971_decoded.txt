u.s. district judge andrew hanen on monday denied the obama administration 's request to lift a time-out he enforced on feb. 16 , when he ruled that a lawsuit filed by 26 states might succeed .
his order was designed , he said , to prevent a situation that could n't be undone if it were declared unconstitutional .
it also seemed to fire a shot across the white house 's bow , blaming the administration for failing to keep illegal immigrants .
