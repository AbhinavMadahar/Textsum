exactly nine puckered capers and a measly two slivers of anchovy perch rather inelegantly atop the pile .
on the side tiny serving of mustard , some slices of gherkin and a wodge of waxed cheese .
to wash it down is a cup of pink-strained tea .
as last meals go , it 's not the most glamorous of repasts .
