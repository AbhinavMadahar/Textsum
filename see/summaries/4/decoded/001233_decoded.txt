michael davis , the father of the arapahoe high school senior who was shot at point-blank range by student karl pierson in 2013 , put forward the proposal on monday .
if the district accepts the terms , claire 's family would sign a binding agreement to never seek damages against it or its staff in exchange for learning everything the school knows about the murder .
this comes following criticism last year that the district did not act on warnings that they received indicating that pierson was dangerous .
