archaeologists working in southern libya have found that large sections of a 350km -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- long escarpment has been built up from dropped stone tools .
they discovered as many as 75 tools in just a single square metre of ground along the slopes of massak settafet , near fezzan , libya .
this is the equivalent amount of rock as that used to build the great pyramid of giza in egypt .
