a 21-year-old man has become the first person in the world to undergo a successful penis transplant .
the ` ground-breaking ' operation took south african surgeons nine hours to perform , and allowed the patient to urinate normally and become sexually active again .
three years ago the man , who remains unidentified , was forced to have his penis amputated after a botched circumcision .
each year thousands of young men , mainly from the xhosa tribe in south africa , have their foreskins removed in traditional rituals .
