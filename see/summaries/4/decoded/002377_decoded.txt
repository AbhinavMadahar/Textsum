dozens of women who were forced to marry boko haram fighters were reportedly slaughtered by their ` husbands ' before a battle with troops in the northeast town of bama .
witnesses said the islamist militants feared they would be killed by advancing soldiers or separated from their wives .
they killed the women to prevent them from subsequently marrying soldiers or other so-called non-believers .
