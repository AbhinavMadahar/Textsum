alex gibney , the director of the scientology documentary going clear , are that cruise allegedly tapped the phone of his ex-wife nicole kidman prior to their split and that he used underpaid workers for his own personal use that were supplied by the church .
the film speaks to former members of the church , one of whom claims that the church did not approve of cruise 's relationship with kidman .
but not to address the allegations of abuse seems to me palpably irresponsible .
