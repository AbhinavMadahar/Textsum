councillors installed new rising posts in gloucester in a bid to promote a ` cafe culture ' but they have already impaled a police car and been blamed for a downturn in trade by shopkeepers .
the posts , which operate between 10am and 5pm every day , have been installed in the city centre on four ` gate ' streets .
