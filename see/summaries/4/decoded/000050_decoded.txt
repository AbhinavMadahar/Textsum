simon stevens , the nhs 's chief executive , announced the pilot scheme , which will be rolled out in 29 areas covering a total of five million patients .
it is hoped the scheme will gradually expand across england with the aim of treating more patients at home , or at their gp surgery , rather than in hospital .
the idea is to bring together hospitals , gps , community services and care homes to provide more joined-up care .
