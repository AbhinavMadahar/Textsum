records claim a staggering 6.5 million ` super-centurions ' have reached the grand age of 112 in the u.s. - but it is all down to missing death certificates .
but in fact there are only 19 people who say they are over the age of 112 in the u.s. today .
the error has been caused because social security does not have death records for millions of people , the oldest of whom was born in 1869 .
