sean penn was criticized for a joke he directed at alejandro iñárritu , right , while handing him an oscar for birdman .
the joke prompted a storm of outrage from critics who branded the comments xenophobic - but penn has today said he has ` absolutely no apologies ' and that the only reason anyone could be offended is their own ` flagrant stupidity '
