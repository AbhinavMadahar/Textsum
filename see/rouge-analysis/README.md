# ROUGE Analysis

These are a series of small Perl and Bash scripts which calculate the ROUGE
score of the summaries generated by the model. To find the overall ROUGE
score, run:

```sh
OUTPUT=analysis.txt;
SOURCE=../summaries;
./analyse $SOURCE >> $ANALYSIS_FILE;
```

The flags are optional. If none are given, SOURCE defaults to ../summaries.  To
pass additional flags to ROUGE, pass them to `analyse`, which will pass them
when calling the ROUGE script.

Note that this may take many hours on consumer hardware. If you rerun the above
command, the pipeline skips summaries which have already been evaluated. I
recommend running
```sh
echo ./analyse >> analysis.txt | at 11:59
```
so that your computer starts analysis at midnight. You can let it run overnight
and your computer will run the analysis as long as it's on, even if you logged
out.

Also, I wrote this code using Canadian English before realising it. Keep this in
mind when (re)naming variables.
